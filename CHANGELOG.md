# Changelog

All notable changes to the AZOM MOZA SimHub plugin are documented here.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-12

mBooster custom-effect and engine-vibration work contributed by
[@tacodevhaydz](https://github.com/tacodevhaydz).

### Added

- **Wheelbase LFE (Low-Frequency Effects) — host-rendered base haptics.**
  Requires base firmware **1.2.10.10+**. Three channels — Engine (continuous),
  ABS, and Gearshift — are computed every frame and streamed to the base at 50 Hz.
  - Each channel's **Trigger / Frequency / Intensity / Smoothness** can be a static
    slider *or* a live NCalc / SimHub-property formula evaluated per tick.
  - **Presets** — four presets (Additive Engine, Big Rig, Detuned V8,
    Road Rumble) plus save / export / import of your own (JSON). The built-in
    engine presets scale intensity by throttle position.
  - Dedicated **LFE panel** with a live oscilloscope drawing each slot's amplitude
    envelope and calculated-value readouts. LFE settings ride along in profile import.
- **MOZA Multi-Function Stalks — Truck-sim mode.** The stalks work as a plain button
  box, or translate stalk positions into keyboard input for ETS2/ATS (only while the
  truck game is foreground): wiper and light-knob positions step the game's cycling
  controls to the mapped stage, turn-signal positions tap the indicators, plus a
  "Re-sync wipers" action.
- **mBooster custom telemetry effects** (experimental) — user-created, formula-driven
  vibration effects on the pedal motor. Each has a name, a live SimHub-property / NCalc
  formula, Frequency and Intensity, threshold-pulse or continuous-proportional modes,
  and a sustained Test toggle.
- **Multiple mBoosters in any topology** — one controller per physical unit keyed by a
  stable USB instance ID (settings survive replug), correct HID + CDC interface pairing,
  and up to three axes per unit routed independently to Throttle / Brake / Clutch by
  per-axis role.
- **Nearly complete FSR1 dashboard support** — every built-in dashboard field ships a
  best-guess default SimHub binding (all overridable); corrected DRS/ERS bit-packing and
  gear bias, plus lap-time and tyre-temp scaling fixes (capture-verified).
- **HGP / SGP shifter support** — reverse-direction toggle and paddle-sync on both;
  SGP adds two configurable LEDs (8-color palette + brightness), HGP adds an H-pattern
  calibration routine.
- **Lamborghini Revuelto (W11) wheel** — a screenless, button-only wheel (16 dimming
  backlit buttons, no RPM LEDs). Added general **non-RPM-LED wheel support**: no phantom
  RPM/flag LED run for button-only wheels, and the max addressable button-LED count
  raised to 16.
- **VGS rotation-mode selector** — off / smooth / immediate for the VGS wheel's
  self-leveling display (per-profile).
- **Mzpreset file import** — Supports importing presets using the new mzprest file format.

### Changed

- **Performance** — hot-path allocations cut (catalog-hash dedup, radar reflection caches,
  gated wire debug, retransmitter fast path, V0/string-channel throttles); radar/track-map
  car positions computed once per game frame and shared across dual-display senders;
  per-worker NCalc engine instances for haptics formulas.

### Fixed

- **Knob mode is correctly applied on profile change** instead of only applying at launch.
- **Pedal/handbrake max travel zeroed for new users** — fixed a race that could set the
  calibrated max travel to zero.
- **CM2 flag LEDs** — the LED bitmask no longer incorrectly blocks flag led activation.
- **Variable-size color packets** — button color data is sent without the previous fixed
  padding, caused issues for some wheels.
- **FSR1 display** now restarts correctly on reload.
- **mBooster pedals** stay in the correct order.
- **Concurrency races** — Interlocked 64-bit stamps, copy-on-write settings dictionaries,
  and timer/thread teardown guards.
- **Lifecycle leaks** — CM1 handler detach, update-banner rehook, park-retry timer dispose,
  and LED-driver restore on plugin End.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-05

mBooster pedal feel and effects work contributed by [@tacodevhaydz](https://github.com/tacodevhaydz).

### Added

- **mBooster pedals — expanded into a full pedal-feel and haptic-effects system.**
  The mBooster tab (per-unit Throttle / Brake / Clutch roles, multiple units
  supported) gained:
  - **Effects** — five cards, each with a live **Test** toggle that substitutes
    pedal position so you can preview by pressing:
    - **ABS** — pulses on ABS activation (Frequency 5–30 Hz, Intensity, Smoothness).
    - **Engine Vibration** — continuous above idle at a fixed Frequency (60–200 Hz)
      and Intensity (replaces the previous RPM-derived mapping).
    - **Road Texture** (new effect type) — road-surface vibration scaled live by
      vertical chassis G-force (roughness proxy), with a firmware-shaped Smoothness control.
    - **Lockup** — ramps in on wheel lock under braking (Frequency now a fixed slider).
    - **Threshold** — pulsed braking-threshold envelope (Trigger Input Level,
      Frequency, Intensity, Vibration Decay).
  - **Pedal Feel** — hardware calibration: dual-thumb Start/End of Travel slider, 
    Front/End End-Stop Stiffness, plus host-side Deadzone (kg), Max Force (kg), and 
    a 5-point input curve.
  - **Sim Input Mapping** — Sensor Output Ratio, Max Threshold, and an output 
    curve whose nodes can be dragged horizontally.
  - **Brake Fade (experimental)** — as brake temperature rises past a configurable
    onset, dynamically rewrites two real calibrations in lockstep (longer Travel End, 
    higher Max Threshold), then restores your configured values as the brakes cool.
  - **Pedal Trace** sparkline (last 5 s) and a live position dot on both curve splines.
  - New reusable UI controls: `MozaRangeSlider` (dual-thumb) and an extended
    `MozaCurveEditor` (draggable spline, Linear/S-Curve/Exponential/Parabolic
    presets, horizontal-drag mode).
- **CM2 Racing Dash — new-era firmware support.** Recognizes two CM2 LED firmware
  eras (legacy RPM-ramp vs. 2026-06 indicator) with bidirectional detection so a
  firmware downgrade recovers.
- **Radar and track-map dashboard channels.** Closes issue #79.
  - **Track map** — every car's position on a mini circuit map
    (`patch/Location_0..63`); please report issues where it does not work as expected.
  - **Radar** — close-proximity spotter data channels(`patch/ri0..63`).
- **FSR1 mapping features** — dashboard fields can be merged, split, or sub-byte / bit-packed (two values
  sharing a byte) with independent bit-offset/width steppers. Addresses #32.
- **Automatic standby mode** — optionally powers the wheel/display to standby after a
  configurable idle timeout (default 10 min), gated on no active game and no HID/UI activity.
- **Host sleep/resume recovery** — hooks `SystemEvents.PowerModeChanged` and forces a
  clean reconnect of the wheel and USB CM2 on resume, rebuilding sessions the firmware
  silently drops behind a half-open serial port (fixes blank display after host sleep).
- **LED master-brightness follows the firmware level** — the brightness slider now
  writes the firmware group brightness (debounced), with per-frame RGB compensated so
  it isn't applied twice.
- **Support adjustable FFB Output sliders** — The FFB output sliders can be dragged left 
  and right supporting full functionality.

### Changed

- **Bundled SimHub updated to v9.11.21** (from v9.11.17).
- **Notification banners** in device pages.  Banner notices now appear in both locations.
- **Background responsiveness** — new `ProcessResponsivenessManager` opts the process
  out of Windows EcoQoS power throttling and the background timer-resolution clamp
  while a game is active, so control writes land live instead of only after alt-tab.
- **Dual-display routing** — a dedicated CM2 sender drives the CM2 regardless of the
  connected wheel; the main sender is now always wheel-only, so the two can't collide
  (CM2 wire target chosen by topology: `0x12` standalone-USB, `0x14` bus-bridged).
- **Session lifecycle** — cold start now performs a narrow `0x01–0x03` session close
  first; catalog-advertise bursts are debounced into a single tier-def emit.
- **FSR1 display refresh** raised from ~29 Hz (35 ms) to ~50 Hz (20 ms), matching expected
  active-play cadence; byte-probe now ramps 0→255→0 so every byte box visibly pulses.
- **FFB parameters are only written when changed** — the applier diffs against a
  per-base cache instead of re-pushing on every hot-attach.
- **Radar/track-map channels are hidden from the channel-mapper UI** (plugin-driven).
- CM1-vs-CM2 identification is now positive-evidence only (removed the 25 s
  no-catalog timeout that mislabeled slow CM2s); CM1 detection is no longer persisted.
- Serial capture moved to the Options tab; About tab updated; removed refresh button.

### Fixed

- **AB9 shifter mode selector** — flight-sim/shifter mode values were
  backwards.
- **UDP steering-lock ordering** — `base-limit` is now written before `base-max-angle`,
  so lowering the lock (e.g. RBR 2700° → per-car) lands in one shot instead of being
  silently clamped until the next write or alt-tab.
- **CM2 cold-start livelock** — a fresh `Start()` is only issued when genuinely idle,
  fixing CS-Pro + bus CM2 setups that started dark.
- **CM2 dash dropping on wheel-rim reset** — dash detection is re-asserted after a reset.
- **Cross-sender stall on a shared bus** — SilenceGate timestamps are per-instance, so
  a CM2 stop no longer stalls the wheel's reopen (~11 s).
- **DisplayWatchdog** no longer restarts a working radar/track-map dashboard on a late
  configJson state, and waits for the live dashboard list before retrying.
- **Dropped-catalog recovery** — re-advertised channel chunks union-fill missing
  indexes and preserve unchanged stable channels on a saturated 115200 link.
- **FSR1 over-throttling and gapless layout** — partitions are guaranteed gapless and
  non-overlapping (stale configs auto-repair) so the wheel never renders a dead byte.
- **FFB detect→reapply→reset loop** on marginal R5 / bare CS bases, via changed-only writes.
- **Fixed import of interpolation** — interpolation no longer imports at 10x the correct value.
- **LED fixes** — Wheel detection is no longer gated on the virtual LED driver; LED keepalive 
  no longer pauses mid-game; LED writes are throttled during catalog negotiation so they don't
  starve inbound radar/track-map channel chunks.


## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-17 — Ncalc, CM2 and ES work, improved channels

> **Breaking:** KS Pro users must reconfigure knob effects — 4 ghost buttons were
