# Unofficial MOZA SimHub Plugin

> [!NOTE]
> MOZA is a registered trademark of Gudsen Technology Co., Ltd. This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by MOZA or Gudsen Technology. All trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

A SimHub plugin that communicates directly with MOZA Racing hardware over serial, providing hardware configuration and LED control through SimHub's native device and effects system. Provides a complete replacement for Pithouse.

Built using the amazing work of [Boxflat](https://github.com/Lawstorant/boxflat) and the intial reverse-engineering of the the [MOZA serial protocol](docs/protocol/README.md).

> [!WARNING]
> If you [sponsor future development efforts](https://github.com/sponsors/giantorth) the money will just be used to buy more MOZA hardware.

## Why This Exists

MOZA makes excellent sim racing hardware, but their companion software — Pithouse — is Windows-only. Linux users have no official way to manage LED effects or stream telemetry to your wheel's dashboard. SimHub, on the other hand, runs on Linux (via Proton/Wine), opening the door for cross-platform hardware control with built-in telemetry support.

This plugin opens up MOZA hardware to the wider world of SimHub.  Drive your leds using [ATSR](https://github.com/ATSR-Alex/ATSR-Hub-EVO/) or [DNR](https://www.danielnewmanracing.com/) plugins.  Map any data point from the thousands in SimHub to display on your wheel dashboards.
The goal is to expand the functionality of MOZA devices to a wider audience by providing tools that work across multiple platforms.  

![MOZA Plugin Settings](docs/Screenshot.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Close Pithouse before using this plugin.** Both applications communicate with MOZA hardware over the same serial port and cannot be open simultaneously. Pithouse must be fully closed (not just minimized) before SimHub can connect.

> [!CAUTION]
> **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.** This software communicates directly with force feedback hardware capable of producing high torque output that can cause serious injury or property damage. This plugin is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. The authors accept no responsibility or liability for any damage to hardware, injury to persons, or any other loss arising from the use of this software. By using this plugin, you acknowledge the inherent risks of controlling force feedback devices via third-party software and accept full responsibility for any consequences.

_Thank you to a gracious alpha tester who provided these custom effect and dashboard videos._

## Installation

Download the latest `MozaPlugin_v*.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/giantorth/moza-simhub-plugin/releases) page and extract `MozaPlugin.dll` into your SimHub installation directory. That single file is the full plugin — every supported language is embedded inside it.

Restart SimHub — the plugin appears under Settings > Plugins as "MOZA Control".

**Development builds.** The latest in-progress build from the `dev` branch is published as a pre-release: [MozaPlugin_dev.zip](https://github.com/giantorth/moza-simhub-plugin/releases/download/dev-latest/MozaPlugin_dev.zip). Expect bugs or broken features — use the stable release above if you need something reliable.

**Device setup:** Connect your hardware and restart SimHub. The plugin auto-detects connected devices (wheel model, dashboard) and deploys matching device definitions. A banner in the plugin settings panel will prompt you to restart SimHub, after which the devices appear under Devices ready to add. Requires SimHub 9.11+.

## Features

### SimHub Device Integration

MOZA wheels and dashboards register as native SimHub devices, appearing in SimHub's **Devices** section. This enables full control of your LEDs through SimHub's effects pipeline — no separate telemetry mode needed.

![Device Panel](docs/Device.png)

- **Per-Model Device Definitions** — Each new wheel attached will get a generated device definition with the LED layout baked in. Definitions are deployed automatically on first detection — just connect your hardware, restart SimHub, and add the device. Requires SimHub 9.11+
- **LED Effects System** — Use SimHub's full Button and Telemetry effects configuration UI (RPM indicators, flags, speed limiter animations, scripted effects, etc.) to control your wheel and dashboard LEDs
- **Per-Game Device Profiles** — SimHub's device profile system saves and restores LED effect configurations per game
- **Model-Aware Connection** — Only the device matching the currently connected wheel reports as connected. Swap wheels and the correct device activates automatically
- **Separate Wheel & Dashboard Devices** — Each registers independently with its own profile and LED configuration
- **Individual LED Effects** — SimHub's per-LED effects reach the hardware in both "Combined" and "Individual LEDs Only" (Exclusive) modes. The virtual driver exposes RPM + button LEDs as one contiguous strip (telemetry first, then buttons) so per-LED effects can target the whole sequence; knob ring LEDs are addressable via the Extra/encoders channel
- **Wheelbase Ambient LEDs** — R21/R25/R27-class wheelbases register as a separate "MOZA Wheel Base" SimHub device exposing the 18-LED ambient ring. Drive it from SimHub's effects pipeline, or use the device page for indicator state, brightness, standby animation (Constant/Breath/Cycle/Rainbow/Flow), sleep mode + timeout, and startup/shutdown colors. R9/R12 bases ship without the LED strip and do not expose this device
- **Per-Wheel Idle & Sleep Effects** — Each wheel's device page has RPM / Buttons / Knobs / Sleep tabs for the hardware's own onboard idle animations (Constant, Breathing, Color Cycle, Rainbow, Sand Flow, RGB Pulse), static RPM/flag/knob colors, and the sleep-light mode + color + standby timeout. These play locally on the wheel when SimHub isn't driving effects (game closed, telemetry paused). Sleep settings persist at the wheel level, not per game
- **360hz and LFE Support** — Supports native control SDK for games that require it (iRacing)

![Device Panel](docs/Knobs.png)

The plugin injects virtual LED drivers so SimHub's effects UI shows each device as connected, even though MOZA uses a proprietary serial protocol. The computed LED colors are forwarded to the hardware each frame.

![Effects List](docs/Effects.png)

SimHub contains many effects to choose from and this plugin supports any custom effects that target a device.

Tested:
- Old-protocol wheels (ES series)
- Multiple Bases
- New-protocol wheels (Vision GS / GS V2P / TSW / KS Pro / CS Pro / FSR V2)
- MOZA handbrake 
- Universal Hub (port enumeration + child-device routing)
- AB9 active shifter (mode + feel sliders)
- Dashboard telemetry + screen updates (confirmed on Vision GS, CS Pro, KS Pro, and FSR V2)

TBD:
- Stand-alone dashboards
- Older generation wheels not in the list below


### Per-Model LED Configuration

Each wheel model has a dedicated SimHub device definition with the correct LED layout. The plugin detects the connected wheel model via firmware queries and deploys the matching definition on first detection.

| Device Name | Model Prefix | RPM | Buttons | Flags | Button Mapping |
|-------------|:------------:|:---:|:-------:|:-----:|----------------|
| MOZA GS V2 Pro | GS V2P | 10 | 10 | No | Contiguous (5 left + 5 right) |
| MOZA CS V2 | CS V2.1 | 10 | 6 | No | Non-contiguous: positions 1,2,4,7,9,10 |
| MOZA CS Pro | W17 | 16 | 8 | No | Contiguous; 4 knobs (12 ring LEDs each) |
| MOZA KS Pro | W18 | 18 | 14 | No | Contiguous; 5 knobs (12/12/8/12/12 ring LEDs) |
| MOZA KS | KS | 10 | 10 | No | Contiguous |
| MOZA FSR V2 | W13 | 16 | 10 | No | Contiguous |
| MOZA Vision GS | VGS | 10 | 8 | No | Contiguous |
| MOZA TSW | TSW | 10 | 14 | No | Contiguous |
| MOZA RS V2 | RS V2 | 10 | 14 | No | Contiguous |
| MOZA Racing Wheel | *(generic)* | 10 | 14 | No | Contiguous (fallback for unknown models) |
| MOZA Old Protocol Wheel | *(ES wheels)* | 10 | 0 | No | RPM LEDs only |
| MOZA Dashboard | — | 10 | 0 | Yes | RPM + flag LEDs |
| MOZA Wheel Base | *(R21/R25/R27)* | 18 | 0 | No | Ambient LED ring (telemetry strip) |

On wheels with flag LEDs, SimHub sees a single combined telemetry strip laid out as `[flag 1-3][RPM 1-N][flag 4-6]`. Configure flag zones in SimHub's effects UI on those slots.

If your wheel model isn't listed or incorrect, the generic "MOZA Racing Wheel" definition is deployed. Check the SimHub log for the `[Moza] Wheel model:` line and report the model name string so a dedicated definition can be added.

### Dashboard Support

![Dash Channels](docs/DashChannels.png)

Wheels with an LCD dashboard (Vision GS, CS Pro, KS Pro, and FSR V2 confirmed; others likely work) can receive live telemetry from SimHub — speed, RPM, gear, lap times, fuel, tyre wear, and so on — streamed via MOZA's multi-tier binary telemetry protocol.

- **Auto-detect dashboard folder.** The plugin scans your Pithouse install for the `.mzdash` source folder; an "Auto-detect" button on the wheel device page picks it up in one click. Subfolders are searched recursively, so the dropdown shows every layout you've authored in the dashboard builder.
- **Hot-reload.** Pick a different layout in the Dashboard dropdown and the plugin re-negotiates the wheel's tier definitions and starts streaming the new channel set without restarting SimHub. If you pick the layout already loaded on the wheel, the plugin detects it and skips the renegotiation.
- **Channel mapping.** The wheel device page has a "Channel mappings" expander to override which SimHub property drives each dashboard channel. Type 3+ characters to search the live SimHub property list (substring, case-insensitive). Leave blank to use the plugin's built-in default mapping.
- **String channels.** Dashboards that include text fields (driver name, session type, position labels, etc.) are supported and encoded as UTF-8.
- **Firmware era.** The Options tab has a "Wheel firmware era" override (Auto / 2024 / 2025 / 2026).
- **Test pattern.** A "Send Test Pattern" button cycles all mapped channels through known values so you can verify a dashboard is wired up correctly without launching a game.

**Important caveats:**

- **SimHub dashboards are not supported.** MOZA wheels render their LCD through firmware using MOZA's proprietary dashboard format. This plugin only streams game data into that format — it cannot push SimHub dashboard templates, HTML overlays, or custom layouts to the screen. Continue using the official MOZA dashboard builder for layout work.

### Per-Game Profiles

All settings are stored per-game via SimHub's profile system and switch automatically when you launch a different game. A profile selector sits at the top of the plugin panel.

### Languages

The plugin UI is localized into **English, Español, Français, Русский**. By default the plugin follows SimHub's own language setting (Settings > General > Culture in SimHub); if SimHub is set to a language the plugin doesn't ship yet, it falls back to your OS UI language, then English. A **Language** picker in the plugin's Options tab lets you override that auto-detection — useful if you want SimHub in one language and the MOZA pane in another.

All translations are embedded directly into `MozaPlugin.dll` — no per-culture satellite assemblies, no extra files to deploy. Translations live in `Resources/Strings.<culture>.resx`. PRs adding a new language are welcome — see the i18n section in [DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the four-step recipe.

### Hardware Configuration

The plugin panel (Settings > Plugins > MOZA Control) exposes read/write control of wheelbase, wheel, handbrake, pedal, and hub settings — rotation angle, FFB strength, damping, wheelbase/game effects, FFB equalizer, output curves, performance output mode, paddle/clutch/knob/stick modes, handbrake modes, pedal calibration, and hub port enumeration — mirroring what Pithouse offers. Tabs auto-show/hide based on what's connected (Base, Wheel, Handbrake, Pedals, AB9 Shifter, Hub, Options, LEDs, Wheel Files, Diagnostics). The Diagnostics tab dumps live wheel identity, dashboard state, and session info for bug reports, with serial numbers redacted by default.

The Universal Hub gets its own tab listing each connected port and the device attached to it, polled every 2 seconds.

The plugin also remembers the last-used wheelbase and AB9 COM ports across SimHub restarts, recovers serial connectivity after sleep/resume, and handles wheel hotswap (swap wheels mid-session and the device definition switches automatically once the new wheel reports its model).

**Gearshift bump.** A tactile pulse fires through the wheelbase on every SimHub-reported gear change, giving you a physical "thunk" through the wheel on each shift. Configurable in the Base tab.  Supports configurable debounce and suppress on neutral options.

### AB9 Active Shifter

Full configuration support for the MOZA AB9 active shifter, surfaced under its own "AB9 Shifter" tab when one is connected:

- **Mechanical layout** — 5+R, 6+R (two patterns), 7+R (two patterns), or Sequential.
- **Feel** — mechanical resistance, spring, natural damping, natural friction, and max output torque limit, each on a 0–100 slider.
- **Engine vibration** — intensity (0–100) and frequency (0–300 Hz) for engine-driven shaker effect.
- **Gear-shift vibration** — pulse intensity (0–100) on every shift.

### Diagnostics & Serial Capture

The Diagnostics tab includes a **Serial traffic capture** section for bug reports:

- **Start capture** records every TX/RX serial frame (wheelbase + AB9 pipes) with millisecond timestamps in memory. Nothing is written to disk while capturing, and the buffer is wiped each time SimHub restarts.
- **Stop capture** reveals the captured frames inline (hex dump, one frame per line) and unlocks the export buttons. Per-direction labels (`T`/`R`) and pipe labels (`wheelbase` / `ab9`) make it easy to correlate with protocol docs.
- **Export bundle (ZIP)** writes a timestamped archive containing:
  - `manifest.txt` — bundle header (plugin version, OS, capture summary)
  - `serial-capture.txt` — TX/RX frame log
  - `diagnostics.txt` — snapshot of the Diagnostics tab text (identity, dashboard state, session info)
  - `moza-log.txt` — every `[Moza]` log line emitted by the plugin since launch (pulled from the in-process `MozaLog` ring buffer, so flush cadence and SimHub log-file location don't matter)
- **Copy capture to clipboard** copies the frame log without exporting a file.

Use this when reporting protocol bugs or unexpected device behavior — attach the ZIP to the issue and the maintainers have everything needed to reproduce.

### SimHub Properties

The plugin exposes these properties for use in SimHub dashboards and overlays:
