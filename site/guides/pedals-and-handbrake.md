If you run MOZA pedals or a handbrake, AZOM gives each axis the same treatment as the
wheelbase: a live input read-out, direction and range, a calibration routine, and a
draggable output curve. The tabs only appear for hardware that's actually connected.

## Pedals

The **Pedals** tab splits into **Throttle**, **Brake** and **Clutch**, each configured
independently. The bars across the top show live input so you can confirm the axis is
moving before you touch anything.

### Direction &amp; range

- **Reverse Direction** — flip the axis if it reads backwards.
- **Range Start / Range End** — trim the usable travel. Set **Start** above 0% to add a
  deadzone off rest; pull **End** below 100% so you reach full input before the pedal
  bottoms out.

### Calibration

Open the **Calibration** section and follow the prompt — press the pedal through its full
travel once and AZOM captures the physical end points. Do this any time the pedal feels
like it isn't reaching 100%.

### Output curve

The right-hand graph maps physical position to in-game input. Drag the nodes, or use the
presets:

- **Linear** — 1:1, what you press is what the game gets.
- **S Curve** — finer control around the middle of travel.
- **Exponential** — gentle at first, aggressive near the end (a popular brake shape).
- **Parabolic** — the opposite weighting, strong early bite.

## Handbrake

The **Handbrake** tab works the same way, with one extra choice.

- **Mode — Axis or Button.** *Axis* reports progressive pull (for rally and drift, where
  partial lock matters). *Button* fires a simple on/off at a threshold, which some titles
  prefer.
- **Reverse Direction**, **Range Start / End**, **Calibration** and the **Output Curve**
  behave exactly as they do for the pedals.

> **Calibrate after mounting.** Pull the handbrake fully once through the calibration
> routine after you bolt it to the rig — mounting tension changes the resting point.
