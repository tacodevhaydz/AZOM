If your wheel has an LCD, AZOM can push live race data to it through MOZA's binary
telemetry protocol — speed, gear, lap times, fuel, tyre temps, flags and more. You pick a
layout, then map each of its channels to a SimHub property.

## Turn on dashboard telemetry

Open your wheel under **Devices**, go to **MOZA Wheel › Dashboard**, and switch **Enable
dashboard telemetry** on. Choose a **Dashboard** layout from the dropdown, and use **Send
test pattern** to confirm the screen is receiving data before you go racing.

The **Display** panel sets screen **Brightness** and **Standby Time** — how long before
the LCD sleeps when idle.

## Map the channels

Each layout exposes a set of named **Channels** (Gear, SpeedKmh, CurrentLapTime, TC, ABS,
tyre pressures…), each already bound to a sensible SimHub property. To change one, click
the **pencil** on its row and search the full SimHub property tree.

Type to filter — for example `gap` surfaces every gap-to-leader and gap-to-player
property — pick one, and click **Ok**. The **Current value** column updates live, so you
can confirm the binding is feeding real numbers.

> **Tip:** Any of SimHub's properties works here, or from other plugins. The display isn't limited to the stock fields.
