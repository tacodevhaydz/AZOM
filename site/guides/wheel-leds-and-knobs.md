Once your wheel is added as a device, its LEDs become part of SimHub's full effects
pipeline — and AZOM also exposes the onboard animations the wheel plays on its own when no
telemetry is flowing. There are two places to work: the **LEDs** tab (SimHub effects) and
the **MOZA Wheel** tabs (onboard behaviour).

## The LEDs tab — SimHub effects

Open your wheel under **Devices** and switch to **LEDs**. Each LED group on the wheel —
**Buttons lighting**, **Telemetry LEDs**, **Knob Indicators**, **Individual LEDs** — gets
its own effects profile that you can edit, import, or manage.

This is standard SimHub LED territory: drop RPM strips, flag colours, limiter animations
and status effects onto each group. For genuinely advanced, telemetry-driven animation,
pair it with ATSR-EVO — see [Advanced LEDs with ATSR](/guides/atsr-led-profiles/) for the
ready-made MOZA profiles and import steps.

> **Combined vs Individual.** The **Individual LEDs profiles** mode lets you draw across
> the whole device for idle animations. *Combined* layers it on top of your regular
> effects; *Individual profile only* replaces them.

## RPM lights — onboard idle

The **RPM** tab (under **MOZA Wheel**) controls the shift lights. **RPM LED Mode** chooses
between **Off**, **SimHub Mode** (driven by your telemetry effects), and **Static**.

The **RPM Idle Effect** is what plays when you're not in a session — **Constant**,
**Breathing**, **Color Cycle**, **Rainbow**, **Sand Flow** or **RGB Pulse** — with an
**Idle Speed** slider. The **RPM LED Colors** row sets the static per-LED colours used when
telemetry isn't sending.

## Knobs — rings &amp; signal mode

The **Knobs** tab configures the rotary LED rings. **Knob LED Mode** and **Knob Idle
Effect** mirror the RPM controls, but the interesting part is per-knob colour.

- **Signal Mode** — set each rotary to report as a **Button** (step clicks) or **Knob**
  (continuous), to match what the game expects.
- **Colours** — click any ring LED, or the centre swatch, to recolour it from the palette.
  **Fill ring with selected** paints the whole ring at once, and **Copy this knob to all**
  replicates one knob's look across the others.
