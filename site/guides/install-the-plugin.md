This is the detailed version of the install — every screen you'll see, in order. If
you just want the short path, the [Getting Started](/guides/getting-started/) overview
has it. Either way the whole thing takes about two minutes.

> **Close Pithouse first.** Pithouse and SimHub both talk to MOZA hardware over the
> same serial port and **cannot run at the same time**. Fully quit Pithouse — check the
> system tray and end it there too — before you launch SimHub.

## 1 · Download the release

Grab the latest `MozaPlugin_<version>.zip` from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/giantorth/AZOM/releases/latest) and
unzip it. Inside is a single file: `MozaPlugin.dll`.

## 2 · Find your SimHub folder

The DLL goes in the root of your SimHub install. On Windows that defaults to:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\SimHub\
```

You can paste that path straight into the File Explorer address bar to jump there.

> **Tip:** Not sure where SimHub lives? Right-click the SimHub shortcut, choose **Open
> file location**, and you'll land in the right folder.

## 3 · Drop in the DLL

Copy `MozaPlugin.dll` into that SimHub folder, alongside the other files. That's the
entire installation — nothing to run, no installer.

## 4 · Enable the plugin

Start SimHub. The first time it sees the new file, it pops a **New plugins have been
detected** dialog. Switch **AZOM** on, leave **Show in left main menu** enabled, and
click **Ok**.

AZOM now appears in the left-hand menu. If you ever miss this dialog, you can toggle the
plugin from **Settings › Plugins** instead.

## 5 · Plug in and restart once more

Connect your wheelbase over USB and restart SimHub again. On this launch the plugin
auto-detects your hardware and deploys its device definitions.

## 6 · Restart to finish

After the definitions are deployed, AZOM shows a **Restart SimHub** banner. This last
restart loads the new device definitions so your hardware is ready to add under **Devices**.

Restart SimHub one more time.
