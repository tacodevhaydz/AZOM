Some titles — **iRacing** in particular — and any game running MOZA's **360 Hz** mode need
the official MOZA SDK. AZOM ships an embedded SDK server to provide all of the same functions you had before. You'll set this up once.

## The SDK tab

Open the **SDK** tab in the AZOM panel.

### CoAP SDK server

Switch **Enable CoAP SDK server** on. This runs a small embedded server on loopback that
provides official MOZA SDK support for games that require it.

> **Why a "MOZA Pit House.exe" appears.** While the server is enabled, the plugin runs a
> tiny stand-in process that shows up in your task list as *MOZA Pit House.exe*. That's
> expected — it lets MOZA SDK apps find the service by name. It exits automatically when
> you turn this off or close SimHub. Enabling this option also stops the real application
> from launching automatically.

### UDP control

The **UDP control server** is a legacy plain-CBOR-over-UDP surface for setting steering
angle. The one known use is the **RSF** build of *Richard Burns Rally*; leave it off unless
you need it.

### Status

The **Status** block confirms the listeners are up — you'll see the CoAP and UDP listeners
reporting that they're bound on `127.0.0.1`. If iRacing's force feedback isn't behaving,
this is the first thing to check.
