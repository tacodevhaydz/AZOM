Installing the plugin connects AZOM to your wheelbase, but SimHub treats your wheel,
dashboard and LEDs as a **device** — and that has to be added once before any of the
lighting or telemetry features appear. AZOM tells you when it's needed.

## 1 · Watch for the prompt

Open the **AZOM** panel. If your wheel isn't registered yet, a banner appears at the top
naming the exact device to add — here, *MOZA CS Pro* — and the path to add it:
**Devices › Add device**.

## 2 · Open Devices and add

Go to **Devices** in the left menu and click **Add new device** (the **+**). SimHub opens
the **Pick a supported device** dialog. Your connected MOZA hardware shows up at the top
under **Devices found on your system** — select it there rather than hunting through the
full manual list.

> If you **cannot find the MOZA device**, make sure you are on at least **v9.11+** of SimHub.

Choose your device and click **Ok**. Your MOZA wheel is now a first-class SimHub
device — ready for the LED effects pipeline, LCD dashboard telemetry and onboard lighting.

> **Don't see it?** Make sure the restarts from the [install guide](/guides/install-the-plugin/) actually happened — device definitions are only deployed and loaded on the launches *after* the hardware is first detected.
