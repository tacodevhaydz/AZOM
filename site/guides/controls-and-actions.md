AZOM exposes 40+ bindable actions — FFB strength up/down, rotation, display brightness,
dashboard switching, work mode and more — each with fine and coarse steps. Map them to
wheel buttons and you can adjust your base without leaving the cockpit. The binding is done
through SimHub's **Controls and events**.

## 1 · Open Controls and events

Pick **Controls and events** from the left menu and stay on the **Controls** tab. This is
the list of every button-to-action mapping on your rig. Click **New mapping** to add one.

## 2 · Bind a button to an AZOM action

The **Mapping Picker** opens. It has two halves:

- **Source** (left) — the input. Press the wheel button you want to use and it
  auto-selects, or pick it from the list.
- **Target** (right) — the action. Choose the **AZOM** plugin and scroll its actions:
  `AZOM.FfbStrengthUp`, `AZOM.RotationDown`, `AZOM.DisplayBrightnessUp`,
  `AZOM.DisplayToggle`, and so on. The `…Coarse` variants jump in bigger steps.

Set the **Input mode** (ShortPress, LongPress, etc.), use **Trigger action now** to test
it lands, and click **Ok**. Repeat for each control you want — a typical setup pairs two
buttons for FFB up/down and two more for dashboard previous/next.

> **Fine vs Coarse.** Bind the normal action to a short press and the `…Coarse` version to
> a long press of the same button, and you get both precision and speed from one input.

## All available actions

Every action is namespaced `AZOM.` and appears under the **AZOM** plugin in the Mapping
Picker's target list. Each one nudges, sets or toggles exactly what the matching control in
the plugin panel does, and persists the change.

### Step actions

Seven settings can be stepped up or down from a button. Each registers four variants — add
the suffix to the base name:

- `…Up` / `…Down` — one **fine** step
- `…UpCoarse` / `…DownCoarse` — one **coarse** step

So `AZOM.FfbStrengthUp` raises FFB by 5 %, and `AZOM.FfbStrengthDownCoarse` drops it by
10 %. Values clamp to each setting's range.

| Base action | Fine | Coarse | Range | Controls |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AZOM.FfbStrength` | ±5 | ±10 | 0–100 % | Base force-feedback strength |
| `AZOM.Torque` | ±5 | ±10 | 50–100 % | Base torque limit |
| `AZOM.Rotation` | ±90 | ±180 | 90–2700° | Steering rotation (angle + max together) |
| `AZOM.DisplayBrightness` | ±5 | ±10 | 0–100 % | Wheel screen brightness |
| `AZOM.Ab9EngineIntensity` | ±5 | ±10 | 0–100 | AB9 shifter engine-vibration intensity |
| `AZOM.Ab9EngineFrequency` | ±10 | ±20 | 0–200 Hz | AB9 shifter engine-vibration frequency |
| `AZOM.Ab9GearShiftIntensity` | ±5 | ±10 | 0–100 | AB9 shifter gear-shift vibration |

> **AB9 actions** only take effect when an AB9 active-shifter profile is loaded.

### Jump to a display brightness

Eleven actions set the wheel screen to a fixed level in a single press, from
`AZOM.DisplayBrightness0` (off) through `AZOM.DisplayBrightness100`, in steps of 10 —
`AZOM.DisplayBrightness50`, `AZOM.DisplayBrightness80`, and so on.

### Dashboard & telemetry

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `AZOM.DashboardNext` | Switch the wheel to the next dashboard layout (wraps around) |
| `AZOM.DashboardPrev` | Switch to the previous dashboard layout |
| `AZOM.DashboardTelemetryToggle` | Toggle telemetry streaming to the active wheel page |
| `AZOM.DashboardTelemetryOn` | Start streaming telemetry to the wheel |
| `AZOM.DashboardTelemetryOff` | Stop streaming telemetry to the wheel |
| `AZOM.TestModeToggle` | Run / stop the synthetic telemetry sweep for testing the dash |

Dashboard cycling needs more than one layout loaded on the wheel; with zero or one it does
nothing.

### Display, base & LEDs

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `AZOM.DisplayToggle` | Blank the wheel screen, or restore it at the previous brightness |
| `AZOM.WorkModeOn` | Put the base in its normal active mode |
| `AZOM.WorkModeOff` | Put the base into standby |
| `AZOM.ClearLeds` | Turn off every LED the plugin is driving |
| `AZOM.CalibrateCenter` | Re-center the wheelbase — hold the wheel at physical center when triggering |
