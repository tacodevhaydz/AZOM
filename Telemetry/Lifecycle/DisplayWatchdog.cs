    /// engagement, configJson gap escalation, configJson stuck-state) with ONE
    /// per-tick verdict that fuses every session's liveness with POSITIVE
    /// content proof, and on a confirmed "display not engaged" verdict drives a
    /// full sender restart (escalating to Park when the restart budget is spent).
    ///
    /// Why this exists — the failure the old design missed:
    /// A diagnostics bundle (CS-Pro 2026-05-31) showed the wheel transport-alive
    /// but the display completely UNBOUND: sess=0x01 b2h carried only type=0x06
    /// seq-acks, sess=0x02 b2h only empty keep-alives, and WheelReportedSlot
    /// stayed -1 across 44 host kind=4 dashboard switches — clicking Test did
    /// nothing on the screen. The plugin reported Phase=Active because the old
    /// engagement gates latched on mere inbound FILLER bytes (acks + keepalives),
    /// and the only content-aware rejection signal the code consumed was the
    /// wheel-initiated CLOSE, which this failure mode never emits. CatalogCount
    /// (18, stale) and ConfigJsonHasLastState (true) were BOTH satisfied while
    /// dead — the only true discriminator was the slot round-trip failing
    /// (WheelReportedSlot never converging to LastEmittedKind4Slot).
    ///
    /// Engaged is therefore defined by POSITIVE proof, never by filler:
    ///   (A) catalog present  AND  configJson device-init/state present.
    ///   (B) the slot round-trip is POSITIVE confirmation only and no longer
    ///       gates the verdict — the wheel's reported slot is authoritative and
    ///       a mismatch never restarts (see EvaluateEngagement Context B).
    /// Filler acks/keepalives and inbound stalls are consumed only as liveness
    /// inputs that REINFORCE a content-absent verdict; they never clear one and
    /// never fire alone against a content-proven wheel. The one place liveness
    /// stands alone is Context C (binding-channel death), and there it means
