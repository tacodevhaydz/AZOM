# Moza mBooster Pedals

Vibration-motor pedal product on USB-CDC PID `0x0008`. The mBooster is a
single analog pedal with a built-in vibration motor — the user picks
whether the pedal serves as throttle, brake, or clutch in the plugin
UI, and the motor is driven by host-rendered effects (ABS, Lockup,
Threshold, Engine) per the documented protocol.

**Multi-device:** the plugin supports more than one mBooster on the
same host concurrently (one each for throttle / brake / clutch is the
canonical layout). Each unit gets its own [`MozaSerialConnection`](../../../Protocol/MozaSerialConnection.cs)
under [`MBoosterDeviceController`](../../../Devices/MBooster/MBoosterDeviceController.cs);
all controllers are owned by [`MozaMBoosterRegistry`](../../../Devices/MBooster/MozaMBoosterRegistry.cs).

## Reference protocol

The user-supplied protocol note in
[`../../MozamBooster — Protocol Note.md`](../../MozamBooster%20—%20Protocol%20Note.md)
is the authoritative wire-format reference. It includes verified
known-good frames against real hardware captures + the host-side
synthesizer formulas the plugin reproduces verbatim (see
[`MBoosterEffectSynthesizer.cs`](../../../Devices/MBooster/MBoosterEffectSynthesizer.cs)).

The plugin-side implementation diverges from the protocol note in only
two ways:

1. **No firmware-version handshake** — the note says there is none.
2. **No probe fallback** — the registry-driven discovery is the only
   path. The serial probe fallback under `MozaProbeTarget.MBooster`
   returns null because mBooster device id `0x12` collides with
   wheelbase Main + AB9 Main, so writing a discovery probe at every
   COM port is high-risk for non-mBooster peripherals.

## Chain topology & connectivity diagnostics

A lane's motor/config device ids are role-based: `0x12` (host) throttle,
`0x1d` brake, `0x1e` clutch — but only when more than one **active**
(motorized) mBooster unit is genuinely present. A **single unit's pedal
always lives at `0x12`** regardless of which HID axis it reports on
(confirmed on three units, support bundles 2026-07-30 and KY3HK4QP: every
response frame came from `0x12`; `0x1d`/`0x1e` never acked anything).

### Active vs passive is the chain discriminator — not the pedal count

One mBooster commonly hosts **passive** pedals (a CRP2 throttle/clutch) on
the same lane. The connectivity diagnostic reports those exactly like
chained units, so counting *connected* pedals mistakes one unit hosting
two passive pedals for a three-unit chain. Only the per-pedal **type**
line separates them.

Support bundle KY3HK4QP (W17, 1.5.5) is the full failure. The device
reported:

```text
Throttle pedal is connected, type: passive pedal
Brake    pedal is connected, type: active pedal
Clutch   pedal is connected, type: passive pedal
PD Linked:[T 1 B 1 C 1]
```

i.e. one active brake plus two passive pedals, everything at `0x12`. The
plugin read `PD Linked`'s count of 3 as a chain and addressed the brake at
`0x1d`. The capture's response tally is unambiguous:

| Target | Writes sent | Responses / write-echoes (`a4 21`) |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `0x12` | 16          | **16**                             |
| `0x1d` | 1212        | **0**                              |

Reads: 52 to `0x12` all answered; 16 to `0x1d`/`0x1e` answered **none**.
Every RX frame in both capture files carries source byte `21` (= `0x12`
nibble-swapped) — nothing else ever speaks. The firmware's own
`param_manage.c … Param NN Written` commit lines appear only for `0x12`
writes; the 140 `0xB3` Max Threshold writes to `0x1d` (correctly encoded,
decoding 184→50→140 kg) drew no commit at all.

Two user-visible symptoms followed, both reported as bugs: Max Threshold
read as **inverted** (with the hardware write discarded, its only surviving
effect was as the host-side `fullScaleKg` denominator — see
[Sim Input Mapping](#sim-input-mapping)), and every vibration effect on the
brake was silently dead.

`MBoosterDeviceController.ActiveAxisCount` is therefore the authority:
`<= 1` active pedals ⇒ single unit ⇒ everything addresses `0x12`. The
calibration fingerprint (`RecomputeChainRoleMap`) short-circuits on the
same signal — with one motor there is nothing to disambiguate, and a host
aggregating several pedals' calibration cannot pass its "exactly one
non-default register" test anyway (KY3HK4QP: throttle `0/95` **and** brake
`3/99` both non-default, so the map stayed null and routing fell through to
the phantom `0x1d`).

A passive pedal also has no motor, so its effect worker must not tick —
otherwise, once every axis resolves to the one real device id, the passive
axes' workers all stream at the active pedal's motor and race the genuine
worker for it (`MBoosterEffectWorker.IsPedalAxisConnected`).

**The verdict arrives long after the detection edge.** The type lines ride
the once-a-minute heartbeat block, so the connect-time apply
(`MozaPlugin.ApplyMBoosterToHardware`, fired from the detection rising
edge) runs before routing is known — ~37 s before, in KY3HK4QP — and
addresses whatever the coarser fallback guessed. `MBoosterDeviceController`
therefore raises `RoutingResolved` once the verdict settles and the plugin
re-runs the same detection-edge path against the correct device id. The
re-apply is the same sentinel-guarded method, so a lane with no overrides
still produces zero traffic. Announcing the verdict waits for the WHOLE
block: the three type lines land ~10 ms apart, and acting on the first
would re-apply against a half-read "0 active pedals" (tracked by
`_axisTypeSeen`, since a pedal reported `not connected !` is type 0 and the
types array alone can't distinguish "absent" from "not reported yet").

The **brake-named singleton** commands — Travel (`0x84`/`0x85`), End Stop
(`0xB2`), Natural Friction (`0xAE`), Segmented Damping (`0xB7`), Max
Threshold (`0xB3`), Sensor Ratio (`26`) — carry no per-pedal selector at
all, so they can only ever configure the pedal that owns that hardware.
Editing them from a passive pedal's page overwrites the ACTIVE pedal's
registers instead: in KY3HK4QP the passive throttle page's 3.8/35.9 mm
travel is exactly what the brake unit committed as Params 48/49. The UI
hides them for a passive pedal, and `ApplyMBoosterToHardware` skips them
for a non-motorized axis so values saved before that gate existed aren't
still replayed on every connect. Max Threshold and Sensor Ratio were
already gated the same way, by role rather than by type
(`MBoosterBrakeOnlyPanel`). The per-role output curve
(`mbooster-{throttle,brake,clutch}-y1..y5`) and raw Direction/Min/Max are
NOT affected — those genuinely are per-pedal registers that the host
aggregates, and a passive pedal has them.

**Inferred from the wire shape, not observed** — no capture of Pit House
editing a passive pedal exists to confirm how it handles this.

**The presence read (`mbooster-presence`) carries no chain information.**
Three distinct topologies all returned raw `[00 02]`: a confirmed
standalone 3-axis unit, a standalone 4-axis unit, and the 2-pedal-chain
capture that originally suggested the last byte was a sub-device count.
The only reliable connectivity source is the group-`0x0E` firmware
diagnostic stream, which the device re-emits about once a minute in one
of two dialects:

|                | Short form (device-type `01-02-00-08`, 3 HID axes)                                   | Long form (device-type `01-02-07-05`, 4 HID axes)       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Connectivity   | `PD Linked:[T 0 B 1 C 0]`                                                            | `Pedals connected state: [throttle 0 brake 1 clutch 0]` |
| Per-pedal type | `Brake pedal is connected, type: active pedal` / `Throttle pedal is not connected !` | same                                                    |
| Sensor dir     | `Sensor Dir:[T 1 B -1 C -1]`                                                         | `Sensor direction: [throttle 1 brake -1 clutch -1]`     |
| Output dir     | `OP Dir:[T 0 B 0 C 0]`                                                               | `Output direction: [throttle 0 brake 0 clutch 0]`       |
| Pot angles     | `T-PD:[min … max … angle …]`                                                         | `Throttle calibrate theta:[min … max … angle …]`        |

`MBoosterDeviceController.LogPedalDiagnosticIfRelevant` parses both
connectivity forms into `ConnectedAxes` (which pedal slots exist — drives
role resolution and the position merge) and the per-pedal type lines into
`AxisTypes` (active = has a motor, passive = no motor). **`AxisTypes` is
what decides chain-ness**; `ConnectedAxes` and the presence read only
bridge the window before the type lines land, since both over-count (see
above).

The broadcast is only emitted about once a minute, so a freshly created
controller (cold start, SimHub plugin restart) would otherwise run
unprotected for up to that long. The plugin therefore persists each
lane's last-known connectivity (`MozaPluginSettings.MBoosterKnownPedals`,
keyed like the per-device settings) and seeds new controllers from it —
the live diagnostic still overrides on arrival. When live connectivity
proves a role is assigned to an axis with no pedal while a wired axis
holds the same role, that provably-stale assignment is cleared across
all profiles (logged one-time heal).

The HID interface exposes 3–4 axes regardless of how many pedals are
wired, and a sole pedal reports on its **role's** axis (brake → Ry =
axis 1), not axis 0. The host `0x12` retains calibration registers for
detached pedals (a standalone brake read back a non-default throttle
register), so the calibration fingerprint that maps roles to chained
motor ids must only consider roles the connectivity diagnostic reports
as wired — see `MBoosterDeviceController.RecomputeChainRoleMap`.

## Routed via wheelbase/hub (RJ45 pedal port, dev 0x19)

An mBooster on a wheelbase's (or hub's) RJ45 pedal port never
enumerates on USB — the base tunnels it as its standard **pedals
sub-device `0x19`**, exactly like any other relayed peripheral, and Pit
House drives it that way too. Same relayed-id pattern as the shifter
(`0x12` on its own USB pipe, `0x1A` relayed). Confirmed on hardware
(support bundle 2026-08-06, W17 base): every pedal read to `0x19`
answers as `a3 91 …`, the ~1 Hz group-`0x25` per-pedal position polls
flow, and the device's full diagnostic stream (PD Linked, per-pedal
type, heartbeat) arrives on the base's `0x0E` channel with source byte
`0x91` (= `0x19` nibble-swapped).

The plugin registers a ROUTED mBooster lane for this hookup: when the
pedal sub-device is detected on a base/hub pipe, its identity is probed
at `0x19` and — model-name `mBooster` being the discriminator against
plain CRP/SRP pedals, which answer the same identity groups — an
`MBoosterDeviceController` is registered over the shared pipe. All
mbooster-* traffic (identity, calibration, `0xb1` motor frames,
keepalive) addresses `0x19`; `0x1d`/`0x1e` are never used on a shared
bus (they belong to other peripherals — `0x1c` is the E-stop). Pedal
positions in this topology arrive via the base HID / merged MozaData —
the routed lane never participates in the position merge and mirrors
the merged values back for its UI bars and effect workers.

An mBooster can also be wired behind an **SRP control box** (plugged in
as the box's brake pedal, box on USB PID `0x0003`). The box relays the
same `src=0x91` diagnostics, but its CDC surface has no routed mBooster
support here yet — captures show only the box answering. For full
features use USB (PID `0x0008`) or the wheelbase pedal port.

## Frame shapes

mBooster uses the same Moza wire framing as the wheelbase
(`7E LEN GRP DEV PAYLOAD CHK` with `data_len` excluding group + device
and the wire-aware checksum that compensates for `0x7E` byte stuffing).
[`MozaProtocol`](../../../Protocol/MozaProtocol.cs)'s checksum +
stuffing routines handle all framing.

### Motor write — cmd `0xb1`

Built inline by [`MozaMBoosterProtocol.BuildMotorFrame`](../../../Protocol/MozaMBoosterProtocol.cs).
14 bytes pre-stuffing.

**Effect IDs** (enum [`MBoosterEffectId`](../../../Protocol/MozaMBoosterProtocol.cs)):

| ID  | Name      | ParamK | Trigger condition (host-side, doc § 4)                                                                   |
| --- | --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1` | ABS       | 2000   | `absActive > 0.1` from SimHub                                                                            |
| `2` | Lockup    | 2640   | Heavy brake (>0.8) + wheels < 30 % of vehicle speed (fallback: brake > 0.9 when wheel speed unavailable) |
| `3` | Threshold | 3080   | Rising edge on brake > 0.6; release at < 0.3 (hysteresis)                                                |

**Known-good frames** (verified against the protocol note's hardware
captures — diff against these in a `SerialTrafficCapture` export to
confirm wire correctness):

```

### Keepalive

Degenerate 0-payload frame targeting device 0x12 — `7e 00 00 12 9d`.
Built by [`MozaMBoosterProtocol.BuildKeepalive`](../../../Protocol/MozaMBoosterProtocol.cs).
Emitted every ~500 ms from `MBoosterEffectWorker` regardless of
effect state. Stops being sent → motor eventually drops connection
state and may stop responding to writes.

**Detection note:** the keepalive and motor frames are write-only —
the device never replies to either. With all effects disabled (the
default for a freshly-detected device) the worker sends nothing else,
so nothing would ever elicit a parseable response for
`MBoosterDeviceController.MarkDetected` to latch onto. `TryConnect`
fires `RequestCalibrationReads()` immediately after the port opens for
exactly this reason — without it the UI sits at "Probing…"
indefinitely until something (previously, only the user manually
clicking "Read from device") prompts a response.

### Disable

Same opcode with `enable = 0` and all params zeroed.
[`MozaMBoosterProtocol.BuildDisableFrame(effect)`](../../../Protocol/MozaMBoosterProtocol.cs).
Sent at every effect deactivation edge AND for all four effect IDs on
controller dispose, otherwise the last-active waveform can latch on
the motor after the port closes.

## Stream lane

All motor frames go through a single per-connection lane:

```text
StreamKind.MBoosterEffect = 17
```

Per protocol note § 4 the worker emits at most one motor frame per tick
(~50 Hz), so a single coalesced lane is sufficient — the latest-wins
behaviour on writer lag is the same property the doc relies on when it
says "the motor plays the instantaneous amplitude you send".

Keepalives go via the one-shot FIFO (`MozaSerialConnection.Send`) so
they aren't coalesced.

## Effect synthesis

[`MBoosterEffectSynthesizer.cs`](../../../Devices/MBooster/MBoosterEffectSynthesizer.cs)
reproduces protocol note § 4 verbatim:

| Effect    | Waveform                                                    |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ABS       | `wave = 0.9 + 0.1 * sin(phase); amp = wave * intensity`     |
| Lockup    | `ramp = clamp(elapsed / 0.5, 0, 1); amp = ramp * intensity` |
| Threshold | 5 Hz envelope: 20 ms full + 120 ms 80 % + 60 ms gap         |
| Engine    | `wave = 0.5 + 0.5 * sin(phase); amp = wave * intensity`     |

Engine intensity is clamped to 10 % at apply time (doc § 4 default
`engineScale = 0.01`, clamped to `[0, 0.1]`) — engine runs
continuously and would dominate the other effects without this cap.

### Effects card UI

The Effects card was rebuilt one effect at a time — Engine first, then
ABS, Road Texture, Lockup, and finally Threshold. All five now have
their own expander with Enable + sustained Test toggles; the
fire-and-forget 1s `TestPulse` mechanism this replaced (originally used
by all four non-Engine effects) has been fully removed —
`MBoosterEffectWorker.FireTestPulse`/`TestPulse` and
`MBoosterDeviceController.FireEffectTest` no longer exist.

Above all five expanders, a **Pedal Trace (last 5s)** sparkline
(`MBoosterPedalTraceViz`, reusing `MozaControls.BandwidthSparkline`
single-series with `MaxValue=100` and `OutBrush=Transparent` — its
second series is unbound, and without that the control's tip-dot
Ellipse still renders at its (0,0) default) plots the currently
selected device's pedal position so the user has a visual reference for
when the effects below actually trigger. Fed from
`UpdateMBoosterCurveMarkers`, which already runs at 30Hz (same cadence
as the curve editors' live position dot) — 150 samples × 1/30s = 5
seconds, `_mboosterPedalTraceSamples` — and reset to a flat baseline on
device switch so it doesn't show a discontinuous mix of two different
pedals' history.

**Engine Vibration** was the first effect rebuilt: it originally had two
real sliders, Frequency (Hz) and Intensity, with Frequency replacing the
telemetry-derived mapping (`clamp(rpm / 20000 * 200, 10, 200)` per doc
§ 4) with a fixed, user-chosen value.

That fixed slider has since been reverted: Engine's frequency is once
again telemetry-derived, this time to match AB9's parametric
engine-vibration model exactly (see `Ab9EngineVibrationWorker.Tick` and
`docs/protocol/devices/ab9-shifter.md`) rather than the old doc § 4
formula — `frequency = EngineRedlineFreqHz × (rpm / redline)`, clamped
to `MBoosterUiConstants.EngineFreqMinHz`/`MaxHz` (60–200Hz), where
`EngineRedlineFreqHz` is the constant frequency reached exactly at
redline (`MBoosterEffectWorker.EngineRedlineFreqHz`, pinned to
`EngineFreqMaxHz`) and `redline` is the game's reported `MaxRpm`
(`MBoosterTelemetrySnapshot.MaxRpm`, threaded from `MozaPlugin
.DataUpdate`), falling back to `EngineDefaultRedlineRpm` (8000, same
convention as `Ab9EngineVibrationWorker.DefaultRedlineRpm` and
`HardwareApplier`'s CM2 RPM-ramp fallback) when a game doesn't report
one. There is no user-facing Frequency slider for Engine any more —
`MBoosterEffectSettings.FrequencyHz` is unused for Engine and kept only
so older saved profiles still deserialize; only Intensity remains
user-configurable. The `rpm > 0.8 × idleRpm` activation gate is
unchanged.

Engine's Test control is a **toggle**, not the "Test 1s" button Lockup/
Threshold still use — ABS used to fire the same kind of one-shot 1s
pulse (`MBoosterEffectWorker.FireTestPulse`, a `TestPulse` with a fixed
deadline) before its own rebuild below, but Engine has no brake
modulation to preview against a live pedal press, so a timed pulse
didn't fit it well. Instead, `Test` turns `_engineTestSustained` on/off
(`MBoosterEffectWorker.SetEngineTestSustained`, wired through
`MBoosterDeviceController.SetEngineTestActive`); while on, the effect
runs indefinitely at the fixed redline frequency (there's no guarantee
a game is running to supply RPM during a test) and live-reads Intensity
from settings every tick (not a snapshot) so slider drags are felt
immediately. This bypasses the `Enabled`/RPM-idle gates entirely, same
as the other effects' test pulses. Three places explicitly turn it back
off so a forgotten toggle can't leave the pedal buzzing: switching the
selected mBooster device in the dropdown, closing the settings panel
(`OnUnloadedStopTimers`), and — same as always — `SendAllDisableFrames`
on controller dispose sends the wire-level disable regardless of this
flag's state.

**ABS rebuild**: three sliders — **Frequency (Hz)** (5–30,
`MBoosterEffectSettings.FrequencyHz`, bounds in
`MBoosterUiConstants.AbsFreqMinHz`/`AbsFreqMaxHz`, default 22 — the
exact value from the "known-good" real Pit House capture above),
**Intensity** (0–100%, unchanged in role), and **Smoothness** (0–100%,
new — pulse modulation depth, `MBoosterEffectSettings.SmoothnessPct`).
Frequency replaces the old ABS-activation-depth mapping (doc § 4:
`18 + abs01*12`, 18–30Hz) — moot in practice since the plugin's
snapshot exposes `AbsActive` as a bool, not the `0..1` float the
pseudocode expects, which collapsed that formula to a constant 30Hz
anyway. Smoothness is a host-side extension to
`MBoosterEffectSynthesizer.SynthesizeAbs`, *not* from the protocol
note: the function now takes a `smoothness01` parameter that
generalizes the ripple depth of `wave = baseline + depth * sin(phase)`,
where `depth = 0.5 - 0.4 * smoothness01`. At `smoothness01 = 1` (100%,
the default — preserves behavior for profiles that predate this
slider) `depth = 0.1`, reducing to the *exact* original verified
formula (`0.9 + 0.1*sin`) that the file's header comment warns not to
modify without verification — untouched, just reachable at one specific
input now. At `smoothness01 = 0` (0%) `depth = 0.5`, matching
`SynthesizeEngine`'s full 0..1 swing for a sharper, choppier pulse.

ABS also gets Engine's sustained Test toggle pattern
(`_absTestSustained`/`SetAbsTestSustained`/`SetAbsTestActive`, replacing
the old 1s `FireTestPulse` path for this effect only) — since ABS has
no live "how hard is ABS engaging" signal to preview against outside a
real ABS event, the toggle substitutes live brake position for
`absActive`, just indefinite and live-tracking Frequency/Intensity/
Smoothness every tick instead of snapshotting them at toggle-on time.
Unlike the old 1s pulse (which fired on any nonzero press, `brakeT >
0.01`), the sustained test gates at 60% brake (`brakeT < 0.6` stays
silent) — the test should only fire once you're pressing hard enough
to plausibly trigger real ABS, not on a light tap. The same three
turn-it-back-off safety nets apply (switching devices, closing the
settings panel, and `SendAllDisableFrames` on dispose).

**Overlap bug found and fixed while rebuilding this card**: pairing a
second `OffOnToggle` (the new Test toggle) next to the existing Enable
toggle, both at the pre-existing `Width="120"`, wasn't enough room for
either toggle's own label text *and* its OFF/ON pill — verified with an
offscreen WPF render (`RenderTargetBitmap`) of the card in isolation,
which showed the pill visually overlapping its own label, and the two
toggles bleeding into each other. Fixed by dropping the fixed `Width`
entirely (letting each toggle size to its natural content — the
`OffOnToggle` base style already defaults to `HorizontalAlignment=
"Left"`, so nothing stretches or clips) and giving the Test toggle a
`24px` left margin instead of `6px`. Re-verified clean at both 860px
and 620px card widths, including after adding ABS's three-slider
expander and the pedal trace sparkline above Engine's. Note this
`Width="120"` pattern is used on `OffOnToggle` instances throughout the
rest of `SettingsControl.xaml` (Handbrake/Throttle/Brake/Clutch/etc.) —
those weren't touched (out of scope here, and each only has one toggle,
not two competing for the same box), but the same latent overlap could
in principle apply to any of them with a long enough label/translation.

A second, unrelated alignment bug turned up the same way while adding
the pedal trace label: `SliderLabel`'s `MaxWidth` combined with its
inherited `HorizontalAlignment="Stretch"` centers the text when the
style is used standalone in a vertical `StackPanel` (as opposed to its
normal home in a `Grid.Column="Auto"`, where the column already hugs
the content and masks the issue). Fixed by adding explicit
`HorizontalAlignment="Left"` to both standalone uses — the new Pedal
Trace label and the pre-existing Start/End of Travel (mm) label above
the `MozaRangeSlider` — while leaving the (unaffected) `Grid.Column`
uses alone.

### Road Texture (effect type 9) — a genuinely different wire shape

**Road Texture** is the third effect rebuilt, and the first entirely
new one (ABS/Engine already existed pre-rebuild; this one didn't).
Confirmed as a *real* Pit House effect via two USB captures (a first
pass isolating the effect generally, then a stepped 0/25/50/75/100%
pass per control) rather than invented — see the original request
context. Two sliders: **Intensity** and **Smoothness**, both 0–100%,
plus the same Enable + sustained Test toggle pattern as Engine/ABS.

Previously only effect types 1–4 were verified against real hardware
captures (the frame diagram literally said "effect type (1..4)"). The
capture confirmed **effect type 9** is real and accepted by the
firmware — sustained valid frames, not silently dropped.

**The wire payload shape is materially different from the other four**,
reverse-engineered from the stepped capture:

```text
7e  09  24  12   b1  09  EN   SH   SL   NH  NL   IH   IL   CK
                 │   │   │    └─┴─smoothness u16 BE  └─┴─intensity u16 BE
                 │   │   └ enable (0 = off, 1 = on)
                 │   └ effect type (9 = Road Texture)
                 └ cmd id (0xb1)
```

- For ABS/Lockup/Threshold/Engine, the pad byte is always `0x00` and
  param1 is a per-cycle scaling factor derived from `ParamK`/freq. Road
  Texture repurposes those exact two byte positions (`pad`, `param1`)
  as the high/low bytes of a 16-bit **Smoothness** value instead.
- The "freq" slot (bytes 9–10, `EncodeFreq`'s home for every other
  effect) instead carries a **live noise sample** — confirmed by the
  first capture, where this field oscillated continuously the entire
  time the effect was on, cycling through roughly ±32700 with a
  ~0.7s period, regardless of what Intensity/Smoothness were set to.
- The "amp" slot (bytes 11–12, `EncodeAmp`'s home for every other
  effect) carries **Intensity**.

**Intensity and Smoothness share one encoding**, verified exactly
against all 8 stepped-capture data points (4 per parameter — 25/50/75/
100% each): `raw = round(pct / 100 * 65536) - 1`, clamped to 0 at
`pct <= 0`. This is a different formula shape from every other
reverse-engineered mbooster value in this doc (which use `* 65535` or
`* 65536 / fullscale`) — a "count-1" full-scale pattern instead. See
`MozaMBoosterProtocol.EncodeRoadTextureLevel`.

**Key architectural finding**: comparing the noise field's amplitude
range and oscillation rate across the 4 different Intensity values (and
separately across the 4 Smoothness values) in the stepped capture shows
neither changed the noise signal at all — same ~63500-64000 range, same
~1.3-1.6 peaks/sec regardless of setting. This means **the firmware
applies Intensity and Smoothness to the noise signal internally**;
Pit House just streams a constant-character reference noise waveform
alongside the two percentage values. Practically: this plugin doesn't
need to reverse-engineer Pit House's exact noise algorithm to work
correctly — any reasonable road-like noise generator satisfies the wire
contract, since the actual shaping happens firmware-side. See
`MBoosterEffectSynthesizer.SynthesizeRoadTextureNoise` (a deterministic
value-noise generator, explicitly *not* a decoded replica of Pit House's
own algorithm, since that wasn't necessary or knowable from this
evidence).

**The ~1.3-1.6 peaks/sec rate above is NOT trusted as Pit House's real
oscillation rate.** It reads the frame-by-frame sample sequence *as* the
waveform, which only holds if the noise is band-limited well under the
frame rate — nothing here established that, and road chatter is exactly
the case where it wouldn't be. Near-full-range excursions (±32700) at
~1.4/sec is the signature of *undersampled* broadband noise. It is also
physically implausible on its face: an effect Pit House ships as "Road
Texture", through a vibration motor, making full-scale excursions ~1.4
times a second is a slow ram, not texture.

The generator originally targeted that rate and consequently felt like
"running over a speedbump every 2 seconds" on real hardware (bug report
`NWS6EY7X`: 13 zero crossings in 18.1 s of emitted samples, 0.72-2.12 s
apart — the plugin faithfully reproducing the suspect number). It is now
two octaves, grain-dominant, and no longer targets that rate.

Note this does **not** disturb the architectural finding in this section.
"Intensity/Smoothness don't shape the noise" is a *comparative* result
across 4 settings each — it holds whether or not the absolute rate was
aliased, since it would have been aliased identically at every setting.
Settling the true rate needs a fresh Pit House road-texture capture read
with frame timestamps, not sample indices.

Because the payload shape differs so much from the other four effects,
Road Texture doesn't go through the shared `ProcessEffect`/
`BuildMotorFrame`/`ComputeParam1`/`EncodeFreq`/`EncodeAmp` pipeline —
it has its own `MozaMBoosterProtocol.BuildRoadTextureFrame` and
`MBoosterEffectWorker.ProcessRoadTextureEffect`, mirroring only the
activation-edge/disable-frame handling from `ProcessEffect`.
`BuildDisableFrame` needed no changes — zeroing every field produces
byte-identical output under either payload shape, matching the real
capture's disable frame exactly.

**Update**: Intensity is no longer a constant level while driving — it's
now scaled live by a road-roughness proxy every tick. SimHub's
`StatusDataBase` has **no generic suspension telemetry at all** (no
`Suspension*`/`Damper*`/`RideHeight*` properties — confirmed by
reflecting on `GameReaderCommon.dll` and cross-checking a live catalogue
of ~7700 SimHub property names; zero matches). The only way to get
*real* suspension travel is per-game reflection into each title's own
raw telemetry struct via `StatusDataBase.GetRawDataObject()` (the same
escape hatch `Telemetry/Frames/GameDataSnapshot.cs`'s
`TryReadRawCarCoordinates` already uses for car coordinates) — accurate
but fragile, since it only works for games whose raw struct happens to
expose it and can silently break if a SimHub game-plugin update changes
that struct's shape.

Chose the generic option instead: `StatusDataBase.AccelerationHeave`
(nullable `double`, vertical chassis G-force) is a real, standard field
present across every SimHub-supported game, and bumps produce vertical
acceleration whether or not a game exposes true suspension data. Added
`MBoosterTelemetrySnapshot.SuspensionHeaveG` (sourced from
`nd?.AccelerationHeave ?? 0.0` in `MozaPlugin.cs`'s `DataUpdate`, same
fail-soft null-coalescing style as every other field on that snapshot)
and a `RoadTextureHeaveScaleMaxG = 1.0` constant (1g vertical accel
saturates roughness at 100%) in `MBoosterEffectWorker`. The activation
gate itself is unchanged (`Enabled && GameRunning && VehicleSpeedMs >
0.5`) — what changed is that the transmitted Intensity is now
`userIntensityPct * roughness01` every tick
(`EffectState.RoadTextureRoughness01`, computed in
`UpdateRoadTextureRequest`, applied in `ProcessRoadTextureEffect`)
instead of the raw user percentage. The effect deliberately stays
"active" (streaming frames) continuously while driving rather than
toggling enable/disable edges on every smooth patch — only the
amplitude drops to near-zero, not the frame stream itself, since
flickering the wire-level enable bit on every dip below some fixed
threshold would be indistinguishable from Threshold's already-solved
hysteresis-latch problem, just reintroduced here for no reason. The
sustained Test toggle previews at `RoadTextureRoughness01 = 1` (full
scale) — like Engine's and ABS's tests, there's no live signal to
preview against outside a real drive, so it just uses the raw
configured settings. A matching `AccelerationHeave` test-mode signal
(`Telemetry/TestMode/TestSignalOverrides.cs`, a fast ±0.6g 700ms
oscillation — deliberately much quicker than the other orientation
signals' multi-second sweeps, to actually look like bumps) lets this be
exercised without a live game.

Caveat worth remembering: this is chassis motion, not actual suspension
travel — a curb strike and a mid-corner weight-transfer G-spike look
similar to `AccelerationHeave`. Good enough for "does the road feel
bumpy right now", not a precise physics replica.

**Update**: reversed the "stay active continuously" call above —
feedback was that a continuously-streaming ambient effect whose
amplitude merely dips low on smooth track doesn't read as "the pedal
triggers when you hit a bump/kerb", it reads as background hum. Road
Texture is now a genuine bump/kerb *trigger*, same "silent unless
something is actually happening" contract Lockup/ABS/Threshold already
have. A single bump only spikes `AccelerationHeave` for one or two 20 ms
ticks — too brief to feel as a motor pulse on its own — so
`UpdateRoadTextureRequest` runs a peak-and-decay envelope instead of
using the instantaneous reading directly: fast attack once
`|SuspensionHeaveG|` clears `RoadTextureBumpTriggerG` (0.15g, a
heuristic like Lockup's brake/speed/wheel-slip thresholds — no
hardware capture backs this since it's a host-side telemetry gate, not
a wire value), then exponential release (`RoadTextureBumpDecayTau` =
0.15 s) back toward zero. `EffectState.IntensityRequest` (and so the
activation edge in `ProcessRoadTextureEffect`) now tracks that envelope
crossing ~0.01 instead of "is the car moving", so the effect goes fully
silent (disable frame sent) between bumps and only streams frames for
the duration of each decaying pulse. `RoadTextureRoughness01` is still
the transmitted-Intensity multiplier, just envelope-shaped now instead
of the raw `|heave| / 1g` ratio.

**Update**: added a directional attack transient so a bump/kerb strike
leads with a punchy "hit" rather than easing in from the ambient noise
baseline — a haptics technique (asymmetric onset transients bias
perceived direction more than steady-state amplitude does), not a
protocol-verified behavior. `MBoosterEffectSynthesizer
.SynthesizeRoadTextureNoise` now cross-fades from a fast-decaying
directional spike (`RoadTextureAttackSign`, exponential decay over
`RoadTextureAttackSec` = 80 ms) into the regular ambient noise for the
first 80 ms of `elapsedSec` (time since the activation edge — i.e. time
since *this* bump started, resetting each time the effect goes
silent-to-active, so a sustained kerb only gets one punch on first
contact, not one per ripple). **`RoadTextureAttackSign`'s polarity is an
unverified guess** at "pushes the pedal face toward the driver's foot"
— there's no capture evidence for which raw-sample sign the
firmware/motor treats as which physical direction (prior Road Texture
work only needed to match amplitude/oscillation character, never a
sign's physical meaning). If it feels backwards on real hardware,
negate that one constant.

### Lockup rebuild

Fourth effect rebuilt, and the most direct port of the Engine/ABS
pattern: two sliders, **Frequency (Hz)** (10–100,
`MBoosterEffectSettings.FrequencyHz`, bounds in
`MBoosterUiConstants.LockupFreqMinHz`/`LockupFreqMaxHz`, default 55 —
the exact value from the "known-good" real Pit House capture above,
"Lockup on, 55 Hz, start of ramp") and **Intensity** (0–100%, unchanged
in role), plus Enable + sustained Test toggle. Frequency replaces the
old brake-position mapping (doc § 4: `40 + brake*30`, 40–70Hz) with a
fixed user-set value — same transformation as Engine/ABS, no new wire
evidence needed since Lockup's wire command (effect type 2) was already
verified.

Unlike ABS/Engine/Road Texture, Lockup's *activation* gate is
untouched — it's the most sophisticated of the four (wheel-slip
detection: `brake > 0.8 && vehicleSpeed > 5 && avgWheelSpeed <
vehicleSpeed * 0.3`, with a fallback for games that don't expose
per-wheel speeds). Only the frequency computation changed; the
detection heuristic that decides *whether* to fire is exactly what it
was before. The sustained Test toggle bypasses that heuristic entirely
(same substitution the old 1s pulse used — live brake position stands
in for "is the wheel locking", since there's no live wheel-slip signal
to preview against outside a real drive), live-tracking Frequency/
Intensity every tick like the other three sustained toggles.

### Threshold rebuild

Fifth and last of the original four effects to be rebuilt (Road
Texture, added between Engine and Lockup, was the only genuinely new
one). Four sliders — more than any other effect, since Threshold
already had more moving parts than a simple frequency+intensity pair:

- **Trigger Input Level** (50–100%, new — `MBoosterEffectSettings
  .TriggerLevelPct`, bounds in `MBoosterUiConstants.ThresholdTriggerMinPct`
  /`MaxPct`, default 60) — the brake position at which the effect's
  rising-edge hysteresis latch fires. Replaces the original fixed
  `brake > 0.6` threshold (doc § 4). The release/falling threshold is
  *not* independently configurable — it stays a fixed 30 points below
  the trigger level (`Math.Max(0, triggerLevel - 0.3)`), preserving the
  original hysteresis gap rather than exposing a second slider for it.
  Default 60 exactly reproduces the original threshold. Bounded at 50%
  minimum since a threshold-braking effect firing on a barely-pressed
  pedal defeats the point.
- **Frequency (Hz)** (5–100, `FrequencyHz`, bounds in
  `MBoosterUiConstants.ThresholdFreqMinHz`/`ThresholdFreqMaxHz`,
  default 70 — the exact value from the `ComputeParam1` "known-good"
  reference table above, "Threshold @ 70 Hz -> 44"). Replaces the old
  brake-position mapping (`60 + brake*30`, 60–90Hz) — same
  transformation as the other three fixed-frequency rebuilds.
- **Intensity** (0–100%, unchanged in role).
- **Vibration Decay** (0–100%, new — `DecayPct`, default 20) — how much
  the pulse fades after its initial burst. Generalizes
  `MBoosterEffectSynthesizer.SynthesizeThreshold`'s fixed "20ms full +
  120ms @ 80% + 60ms gap" envelope (protocol-note-verified, same
  "do not modify" caveat `SynthesizeAbs` carries) into `sustain =
  intensity * (1 - decay/100)`. At the default 20, `1 - 0.2 = 0.8`
  exactly reproduces the original verified 80% sustain — same
  "reduces to the exact reference at its default" pattern used for
  ABS's Smoothness. 0 barely decays (near-full strength for the whole
  120ms); 100 drops to silence immediately after the burst, for a
  short, sharp tick instead of a sustained buzz.

The sustained Test toggle shares the *same* rising-edge hysteresis as
real gameplay — `_thresholdLatched` and the trigger/release thresholds
are computed once per tick and used by both the test and real paths,
whichever is active — rather than bypassing it like ABS's/Lockup's
tests bypass their own detection logic. The effect deliberately
doesn't fire on a light tap during testing: it only latches once brake
position crosses the configured Trigger Input Level, same as it would
in real gameplay, so the Test toggle actually verifies whether the
chosen threshold feels right instead of firing on anything. Frequency/
Intensity/Decay are still live-tracked from settings every tick (not
snapshotted); Trigger Input Level's *effect* on the live substituted
"live brake position" is real, not bypassed. This was also the last
effect using the old fire-and-forget 1s `TestPulse` mechanism — with
Threshold's rebuild, that whole mechanism (the `TestPulse` class,
`_thresholdPulse` field, `MBoosterEffectWorker.FireTestPulse`, and
`MBoosterDeviceController.FireEffectTest`) has been deleted entirely,
since nothing constructs one anymore.

### Brake Fade — real Travel End + Max Threshold calibration override, not a vibration effect

Sixth effect added. The motivating request was literal: "make the
pedal feel like it goes long (more travel needed for the same brake
force) when the brakes overheat, and softer/needing more pressure to
reach 100%" — i.e. simulate brake fade as an actual change in pedal
feel, not a buzz representing one. First attempt was a haptic
warning-cue effect (a sustained buzz on a new, uncaptured wire effect
type) — rejected on a second pass in favor of what was actually asked
for: dynamically rewriting TWO real hardware calibrations in lockstep.

- `mbooster-brake-travel-end` (cmdId `0x85`, the same wire command
  `TravelEndMm`'s own Pedal Feel slider writes) — more physical travel
  needed to reach 100%.
- `mbooster-brake-threshold` (cmdId `0xB3`, the same wire command
  `MaxThresholdKg`'s own Sim Input Mapping slider writes) — more
  load-cell force needed to reach 100%. This is the "softer to press"
  half, and it specifically has to be `MaxThresholdKg`, not the
  similarly-named `MaxForceKg` (Pedal Feel) — `MaxForceKg` is
  host-side only with no wire command at all (see "Pedal Feel" below),
  so ramping it would only change what this plugin's own dashboard
  reads, not what the game actually receives. `MaxThresholdKg` is the
  real, hardware-level equivalent, same category of command as
  `TravelEndMm`.

Both restore to the user's configured base value as brake temperature
cools. No new/unverified wire ID involved for either — both reuse
commands already confirmed real via Pit House USB captures.

**This trades a hardware-verification risk for a different one: write
frequency on a calibration channel.** Every other calibration write in
this app — `TravelStartMm`/`TravelEndMm`, `EndstopFrontStiffness`/
`EndstopEndStiffness`, `CurveY`, `MaxThresholdKg` — only fires when a
user drags a slider thumb, i.e. rarely, by design. There's no capture
evidence or protocol-note guidance on whether the device is fine being
written to repeatedly in real time (e.g. EEPROM wear if the firmware
persists every write to flash rather than holding it in RAM until some
explicit "commit"). `MBoosterEffectWorker.UpdateBrakeFadeTravelEnd`/
`UpdateBrakeFadeThreshold` each mitigate this with their own explicit
throttle rather than writing on every 20ms tick:

- `BrakeFadeWriteMinIntervalSec = 0.5` — at most one write every 500ms,
  per calibration (Travel End and Max Threshold throttle independently).
- `BrakeFadeWriteMinDeltaMm = 0.2` / `BrakeFadeWriteMinDeltaKg = 1.0` —
  ignore target changes smaller than this (brake temp telemetry can be
  noisy; not every fluctuation should become a wire write).
- **Exception**: restoring to the exact configured base value (brakes
  cooled below onset, or the effect gets disabled) always goes through
  immediately for both, bypassing both the interval and delta checks —
  this is a safety action, not a cosmetic ramp step, so it's never
  throttled away.

**Each calibration requires its own known-safe value to restore to, or
it individually stays fully inert.** `TravelEndMm`'s and
`MaxThresholdKg`'s shared `-1` sentinel means "not yet set from this
plugin" — the plugin doesn't know what the device's real current
calibration is in that state (see "Pedal Feel" below on the Max Force
fix that hit this same wall for `MaxThresholdKg` specifically). If
`TravelEndMm < 0`, the travel-extension half does nothing; if
`MaxThresholdKg < 0`, the force half does nothing — independently, so
a user who's only configured one of the two still gets that one
working. The user must configure both base values (drag the Pedal Feel
Travel range slider and the Sim Input Mapping Max Threshold slider,
each once) to get the full combined effect.

**Residual shutdown risk, explicitly accepted, not fully closed.** If
the app is force-quit or crashes while brake temp is above onset (an
override is live), the device can be left holding the extended
Travel End / raised Max Threshold indefinitely — there is no watchdog
outside this worker's own tick loop. `MBoosterEffectWorker.Stop()`
makes a best-effort restore attempt (`TryRestoreBrakeFadeOnStop`)
covering both calibrations on the common clean-disconnect/
plugin-shutdown path, but this cannot cover an abrupt process kill. If
the pedal ever feels permanently "long and soft" after an unclean exit,
dragging the respective slider once (which always writes) fixes it
immediately.

**Telemetry**: `MBoosterTelemetrySnapshot.BrakeTempC`, sourced from
`StatusDataBase.BrakesTemperatureMax` (peak across all 4 corners — any
one wheel overheating should trigger fade) in `MozaPlugin.cs`'s
`DataUpdate`, normalized to Celsius via a fail-soft substring check on
`TemperatureUnit` (contains "F" → treat as Fahrenheit and convert;
otherwise assume Celsius — the same "unit gotcha" style already used
for `VehicleSpeedMs`'s km/h→m/s conversion, since the real set of
`TemperatureUnit` string values SimHub's game plugins write isn't
documented anywhere). Confirmed to genuinely exist as a
`StatusDataBase` member (verified by reflecting `GameReaderCommon.dll`
directly) — but per-corner brake temp is less universally populated by
individual SimHub game plugins than basics like `Brake`/`SpeedKmh`, so
0 (unpopulated) is a real possibility for some titles, in which case
`ramp01` never exceeds 0 and the effect never fires.

**Design**, in `MBoosterEffectWorker.UpdateBrakeFade` — called every
tick, computes one shared `ramp01` fraction from brake temp (or 1.0
while the sustained Test toggle is on, or 0.0 while disabled) and
passes it to `UpdateBrakeFadeTravelEnd`/`UpdateBrakeFadeThreshold` so
both calibrations progress in lockstep. Neither touches the
motor-stream slot or vibration priority ladder at all (this is a
completely separate mechanism from the other five effects). One
slider:

- **Onset Temperature (°C)** (300–900,
  `MBoosterEffectSettings.BrakeFadeOnsetC`, bounds in
  `MBoosterUiConstants.BrakeFadeOnsetMinC`/`MaxC`, default 550) — the
  brake temperature above which both calibrations start ramping. Unlike
  Lockup's hardcoded wheel-slip heuristic, this is user-configurable
  because real fade onset varies hugely by pad compound and game (road
  pads ~300°C, race pads 600°C+).

Each calibration ramps linearly from its own base value at
`BrakeFadeOnsetC` to its own cap
(`MBoosterUiConstants.BrakeFadeMaxTravelEndMm` = 47.9mm, explicitly
below `TravelMaxMm`'s 49.7mm slider ceiling per direct instruction, not
derived from any spec; `BrakeFadeMaxThresholdKg` = 200kg, the
theoretical full-scale `MaxThresholdKg`'s own wire encoding uses) at
`BrakeFadeOnsetC + BrakeFadeSpanC` (`BrakeFadeSpanC = 200`, fixed, not
user-configurable — same "one configurable knob, one fixed span"
pattern Threshold's trigger/release hysteresis uses). If a base value
is already at or above its own cap, there's no room to extend and that
calibration is a no-op (never shrinks below the user's own configured
base).

The sustained Test toggle forces both caps for as long as it's on
(same always-allow-off semantics as the other effects' tests — see
`MBoosterDeviceController.SetEngineTestActive`), bypassing Enabled and
the temperature gate — there's no live brake-temperature signal to
preview against outside a real drive with genuinely hot brakes, and
unlike those tests, this one produces a real, physically verifiable
change: the pedal should visibly/physically require more travel and
more force while the test is on, and snap back the moment it's
switched off.

### Custom Effects — user-defined NCalc/SimHub-driven vibration (Experimental)

Seventh addition to the Effects card, and the first that isn't a fixed,
pre-built effect: a user-addable list of custom effects
(`MBoosterDeviceSettings.CustomEffects`, `List<MBoosterCustomEffect>`),
each rendered as its own Expander in the "Custom Effects (Experimental)"
card below the five built-in effects. Each entry has Name, Enable, a
Formula field, an optional Threshold gate, and Frequency/Intensity
sliders. A "+ Add Custom Effect" button creates a new blank entry; each
entry's own "Delete Effect" button removes it.

**Formula editing reuses SimHub's own property-binding UI verbatim** —
the same dual-mode pencil/ƒₓ editor `docs/ncalc-channel-mapping.md`
already built for the telemetry channel-mapper, applied to
`MBoosterCustomEffect.Formula` instead of a channel's `SimHubProperty`.
`MBoosterCustomEffectRow` (`UI/MBoosterCustomEffectRow.cs`) carries its
own copy of the sync/serialize logic
(`Expression`/`ApplyEditedFormula`/`MakeExpression`/
`ApplyStoredToExpression`/`SerializeExpression`) mirroring
`Devices/Ui/ChannelMappingRow.cs` line-for-line minus the FSR1/CM1
boundary-stepper baggage that doesn't apply here:

- **Pencil** → the simple inline editor: a filterable, virtualized list
  of every live SimHub property name (`MozaPlugin.GetAllSimHubPropertyNames()`,
  snapshotted once per tab repopulate so every row shares one backing
  list). Picking one commits a bare property path.
- **ƒₓ** → SimHub's own `BindingEditor` dialog (`SimHub.Plugins
  .OutputPlugins.EditorControls`), opened against the shared
  `NCalcEngineBase` (`MozaPlugin.ChannelFormulaEngine`) and a throwaway
  copy of the row's `ExpressionValue` so the dialog never mutates the
  live formula mid-edit — full NCalc `[prop]` expressions or a `js:`
  JavaScript escape, exactly as in the dashboard/channel-mapper formula
  dialog. `SettingsControl.MBoosterAdvancedEditFormula_Click` is a
  byte-for-byte port of `DashboardManagementControl
  .AdvancedEditMapping_Click`, retargeted at the custom-effects row
  collection.

Formula stays a single persisted string (`MBoosterCustomEffect.Formula`)
exactly like `ChannelDefinition.SimHubProperty` — no schema/persistence
change from either editor path, both just write back through the row's
`Formula` setter.

**Two modes**, mirroring the built-ins' pulse-vs-continuous split:

- **Threshold off** (default) — the formula's value (clamped 0..1) scales
  Intensity every tick, continuously, like Engine. The user's formula is
  responsible for producing a sensible 0..1 range.
- **Threshold on** — a pulse trigger: the effect vibrates at the
  configured fixed Intensity whenever the formula's value is `>=`
  Threshold, like Lockup/Threshold. No release hysteresis (unlike the
  built-in Threshold effect's 30-point gap) — this is a v1 simplification.

**Wire transport — no new protocol ID.** There is no verified wire effect
type for arbitrary user content (only 1/2/3/4/9 are confirmed real — see
"Effect IDs" above), so every custom effect is transmitted using the
already-verified **Engine (effect type 4)** frame shape, `ParamKEngine`,
and Engine's own plain-sine waveform
(`MBoosterEffectSynthesizer.SynthesizeEngine`) —
`MBoosterEffectWorker.ProcessCustomEffect`. This means a custom effect
shares Engine's exact wire slot: if a custom effect and the real Engine
effect (or another custom effect) are active in the same tick, only the
last one processed reaches the motor (same latest-wins masking rule as
every other pair in the priority ladder — see "Stream lane" above).
Custom effects are emitted right after Engine/Road Texture and before
Abs/Lockup/Threshold in `Tick()`, so a real safety-relevant braking cue
always overrides an experimental custom effect, but a custom effect can
override ambient Engine vibration.

Capped at `CustomEffectScaleMax = 0.10` (same ceiling as Engine) since a
continuous-mode custom effect can run indefinitely and would otherwise
dominate the other effects, same rationale as Engine's own cap.

**Per-effect state** lives in `MBoosterEffectWorker._customEffectStates`
(`Dictionary<string, EffectState>` keyed by `MBoosterCustomEffect.Id`, a
GUID stable across list edits/reorders). An effect deleted from the
settings list has its worker state pruned each tick
(`UpdateAndProcessCustomEffects`) — if it was still vibrating, a disable
frame is sent first so the last-active waveform can't latch, same rule
every other effect's deactivation edge follows.

**Formula evaluation** reuses `SimHubPropertyResolver.ResolveAsDouble`
(threaded into the worker via a `Func<string, double>` constructor
parameter — `MozaMBoosterRegistry` → `MBoosterDeviceController` →
`MBoosterEffectWorker`, mirroring the existing `settingsLookup`/
`isShuttingDown` injection pattern) rather than the fixed
`MBoosterTelemetrySnapshot` struct the built-in effects read — the whole
point of NCalc formulas is access to *any* SimHub property, not just the
9 fields the snapshot carries. Evaluated live every tick (not cached), so
editing the formula text is felt immediately; a bad/unresolvable formula
reads as `0` (fail-soft, matching every other NCalc consumer in this app)
rather than throwing.

Has the same sustained Test toggle pattern as the five built-ins
(`MBoosterEffectWorker.SetCustomEffectTestSustained`, keyed by effect id
in a `ConcurrentDictionary<string, bool>` rather than one bool field since
the count is unbounded): while on, the effect runs continuously at its
live Frequency/Intensity, bypassing Enabled/Formula/Threshold entirely —
there's no live signal to preview a user's arbitrary formula against
outside whatever it's actually wired to, same substitution Engine's own
test toggle uses. Never persisted (fresh row instances always start
unchecked); explicitly turned off when switching the selected mBooster
device or closing the settings panel
(`SettingsControl.StopAllCustomEffectTests`), same safety net the other
five effects' tests have.

## Calibration surface (experimental)

The protocol note marks the pedal-config command surface (group 35
read, group 36 write) as "likely but unverified" on mBooster firmware.
The plugin ships the full surface in
[`MozaCommandDatabase.cs`](../../../Protocol/MozaCommandDatabase.cs)
under the `mbooster-*` prefix anyway — the user opted in. The UI's
Calibration card (Direction / Min Raw / Max Raw / Read from device /
Apply) surfaces this as experimental with a yellow warning.

Every one of these registers is **flash-backed**, and each write
additionally drags the 6-frame [curve7 resync](#pedal-feel)
behind it, so the slider handlers must not write per tick. Bundle KY3HK4QP
(AZOM's own traffic, not a Pit House capture — the plugin unconditionally
tacked the resync onto every calibration write at the time) shows the cost
unthrottled: a ~2 s Max Threshold drag emitted 77 threshold and 462 curve7
frames — ~40 writes/second into flash. UI writes are therefore parked
latest-wins per (device, command) and flushed once the drag settles
(`MBoosterDeviceController.QueueCalibWrite`, ~400 ms quiet window — the
same shape `HardwareApplier.QueueWheelCfgWrite` uses for the wheel's own
flash-backed writes). The resync rides *inside* the parked action so it can
never be reordered ahead of the write it commits. The connect-time apply
(`MozaPlugin.ApplyMBoosterToHardware`) fires immediately and is not parked.
**Update (bug bundle 5VR5AQ8Y):** an isolated real Pit House capture of
Max Threshold alone (`max-threshold-4-41-105-153-200.pcapng`) shows zero
curve7 traffic — Pit House itself never sent the 462 frames the KY3HK4QP
number implied were needed. The resync is no longer sent for Max
Threshold (nor for Deadzone/Max Force — see below); this quiet-window
parking still applies to whichever calibrations still carry it.

## Sim Input Mapping

Two real hardware calibrations, plus a purely host-side output curve, all
on the pedal's own unit (`MotorDeviceForRole` — see
[Chain topology](#chain-topology--connectivity-diagnostics)).

- **Sensor Output Ratio** (`SensorOutputRatioPct`, 0–100%) — blends the
  angle sensor (0%) against the load cell (100%). Wire command
  `mbooster-brake-angle-ratio` (cmdId `26`, 4-byte float), the same command
  the wheelbase's own Brake-tab "Sensor Ratio" slider drives via
  `pedals-brake-angle-ratio`.
- **Max Threshold** (`MaxThresholdKg`, 0–200 kg) — the load-cell force at
  which output reaches 100%. Wire command `mbooster-brake-threshold` (cmdId
  `0xB3`), a 4-byte **big-endian uint, not a float**:
  `raw = round(kg * 65536 / 200)`. Verified on two capture points (4 kg →
  1311 exactly; an unlabeled capture decoding to ~126 kg against an
  independently-reported real Pit House setting of ~125 kg). See
  `MozaMBoosterProtocol.EncodeThresholdKg`/`DecodeThresholdKg`.
  **CORRECTED**: earlier text here claimed this write "recalibrates the
  sensor's own full-scale range on the DEVICE" (raw HID axis reads
  `MaxThresholdKg` of force at 100%). Hardware testing disproved that: the
  write demonstrably reaches the device and reads back correctly (same
  "write succeeds ⇒ assumed real" reasoning that also mis-closed the Max
  Force "does nothing" reports twice — KY3HK4QP, 5VR5AQ8Y — before *that*
  turned out to need the Pedal Feel curve to actually have a shape), but
  changing it does not change how much force the raw HID axis needs to
  reach 100%, confirmed with Max Force held constant and Threshold swept
  full range both directions. The raw HID axis's 100% is actually **Max
  Force's own kg ceiling** (the Pedal Feel curve's real hardware full
  scale — see below). Max Threshold is therefore implemented **host-side**
  instead (`MozaMBoosterRegistry.OnHidAxisUpdate`): it rescales the raw
  position — already 0–100% of Max Force's span — into 0–100% of
  Threshold's span (`posPct * (MaxForceKg / ThresholdKg)`, clamped to 100)
  before the Sim Input Mapping curve ever sees it, the same category as
  Sim Input Mapping's own CurveY/CurveX below (no wire command actually
  does the real work). The `mbooster-brake-threshold` write is still sent
  (harmless, matches whatever Pit House itself does with the field even if
  it isn't the mechanism that matters) but AZOM no longer depends on it.
- **Output curve** (`CurveY`/`CurveX`, 6 nodes + an implicit fixed origin
  at (0,0)) — **REVISED, bug bundle 5VR5AQ8Y**: this is now confirmed
  **purely host-side, with no wire command at all**. It used to be
  believed to write through `mbooster-{throttle,brake,clutch}-y1..y5`
  (15 commands, confirmed-real but for the wrong shape) and, in an
  even earlier iteration, an experimental `curve7` resync (`0xAB`
  selectors `0x01`-`0x06`) — both are now removed; see
  [Removed: `y1..y5` and `curve7`](#removed-y1y5-and-curve7-historical)
  below. What this curve actually does: it remaps the pedal's raw HID
  position — which by the time AZOM reads it already reflects Deadzone,
  Max Force, and the Pedal Feel curve's real hardware shaping (see
  [Pedal Feel](#pedal-feel) below) — into whatever value AZOM reports as
  game telemetry (`MozaData.{Throttle,Brake,Clutch}Position`). Applied in
  `MozaMBoosterRegistry.OnHidAxisUpdate` via
  `EvaluateCurveArbitraryX(cfg.CurveX, cfg.CurveY, posPct)`, in the exact
  spot `InputCurveY`'s host-side application used to occupy before Pedal
  Feel moved to hardware. Nodes are draggable both vertically (`CurveY`)
  and horizontally (`CurveX`, via `AllowHorizontalDrag` on the curve
  editor) — a dragged last node lets "100% output" happen before "100%
  input," since the evaluator plateaus at the last node's Y beyond its X
  (same trick as before, just now the ONLY consumer of the shaped value
  is AZOM's own telemetry, not a second wire push). Default (un-dragged)
  breakpoints are `100/6 × k` for k=1..6 (≈16.67/33.33/50/66.67/83.33/100%),
  evenly spaced with the last node at exactly 100% — so an untouched
  curve maps full input to full output, and "100% before 100%" only
  happens once a user explicitly drags the last node inward. **Bug,
  fixed**: this used to be `100/7 × k` (last node ~85.71%, not 100%),
  inherited from matching the (now-removed, disproven) `curve7`
  mechanism's own selectors purely so a never-dragged node would render
  identically to the old experimental shape — which meant Linear (and
  every other preset) topped out around 86% instead of reaching 100%.
  `MozaPlugin.FixMBoosterCurveArraysSeventhsBug` is a one-shot migration
  that repairs any profile that saved one of the old preset shapes.

Both hardware calibrations use the shared `-1` "not yet set / no override"
sentinel, so a fresh profile never overwrites what is already on the
device. `CurveY`/`CurveX` are `null` by default (identity / no remapping)
— existing profiles are unaffected until a user opens this section.

## Pedal Feel

A card to the left of Sim Input Mapping holds `InputCurveY` on
`MBoosterDeviceSettings` — 6 nodes.
**FURTHER REVISED**: each node is also draggable horizontally via
`InputCurveX` — see [Node X position](#pedal-feel-node-x-position) below;
the "Y-only (no X-dragging)" claim that used to be here was wrong.
**REVISED, bug bundle 5VR5AQ8Y**: this is now confirmed **real hardware
calibration**, not host-side shaping. It directly populates the 6
interpolated selectors already reverse-engineered for Deadzone/Max Force
(`mbooster-brake-feelcurve-1..6`, cmdId `0xAB` selectors `0x08`-`0x0D` —
see [Deadzone / Max Force](#deadzone--max-force--revised-real-hardware-calibration-not-host-side-bug-bundle-5vr5aq8y)
below) — Deadzone (`0x07`) and Max Force (`0x0E`) stay their own separate
anchor sliders, untouched by the curve. Each node's UI value is a
percentage (0-100%) of the Deadzone→Max Force span; the wire value per
node is `kg = deadzoneKg + (nodePct/100) × (maxForceKg − deadzoneKg)`,
encoded via the same `MozaMBoosterProtocol.EncodeThresholdKg` every kg
field in this family uses. See `MozaMBoosterRegistry.ComputeFeelCurve`
and `MBoosterDeviceController.PushFeelCurveResync`.

Since the device now shapes this curve's effect into the raw HID axis
itself, the OLD host-side application (`MozaMBoosterRegistry
.EvaluateInputCurve`, applied to the raw HID position before it became
`c.LastHidPosition`/game telemetry) has been **removed** — keeping it
would have double-applied the curve on top of what the hardware already
did, the same class of bug the original Deadzone/Max Force host-side
implementation had. `CurveY` (Sim Input Mapping, above) is unaffected —
it's a completely separate, still-host-side remap that runs where
`EvaluateInputCurve` used to.

The curve's default (un-dragged) X breakpoints — `{8.049, 19.495, 44.245,
72.433, 90.040, 97.910}%` of the Deadzone→Max Force span — are the SAME
constants documented under Deadzone/Max Force below
(`MozaMBoosterRegistry.FeelCurveFractions`), now reframed twice over: they
were originally measured as a fixed interpolation *formula*, then
recognized as Pit House's own un-dragged default SHAPE (Y=X trivially
holds for any untouched curve regardless of the real breakpoint spacing),
and — see [Node X position](#pedal-feel-node-x-position) immediately below —
now confirmed to be draggable on the wire too, not just visually. `null`
(the default, on either `InputCurveY` or `InputCurveX`) means "use this
Linear default" — existing profiles are unaffected until a user opens this
section. Same passive-pedal protection as Deadzone/Max Force
(`MBoosterDeadzoneMaxForcePanel` in `SettingsControl.xaml`) — this is a
brake-named singleton `0xAB` write with no per-pedal selector, so editing
it from a passive pedal's page would overwrite the active pedal's
registers instead.

### Pedal Feel default curve shape and node X domain — REVISED (mBooster "Deadzone slider does nothing" report)

**REVISED**: the `{8.049, 19.495, 44.245, 72.433, 90.040, 97.910}%` default
shape claimed above is **wrong**, and the node X domain claim ("percentage
of the Deadzone→Max Force span, same as Y") is wrong for X specifically.
A report that the Deadzone slider had no perceptible effect on
Throttle/Clutch mBoosters prompted four fresh isolated sweeps —
`clutch-0-8kg-deadzone-sweep.pcapng`, `clutch-4-20kg-maxforce-sweep.pcapng`,
`throttle-0-6kg-deadzone-sweep.pcapng`, `throttle-4-20kg-maxforce-sweep
.pcapng` — each holding the curve at its un-dragged default and sweeping
only Deadzone or only Max Force:

- **Y nodes** (`0x08`-`0x0D`): `(value − deadzone) / (maxForce − deadzone)`
  landed within ~0.005 of **`k/7` for k=1..6** (evenly-spaced sevenths) at
  every sweep point, on both roles — not the asymmetric constants above.
  Those constants were measured off a single Brake unit's un-dragged curve
  in the original `max-force-24-75-128-166-200.pcapng` /
  `deadzone-0-5-11-14.pcapng` captures and assumed to be the factory
  Linear default; that unit had almost certainly already picked up a
  non-default curve from earlier testing in the same session. The
  `(value − deadzone) / (maxForce − deadzone)` RELATIONSHIP for Y itself
  still holds exactly — only the specific fraction constants were wrong.
- **X nodes** (`0x01`-`0x06`): stayed **bit-for-bit identical** across an
  entire Deadzone sweep AND an entire Max Force sweep, on both roles —
  proving X is NOT relative to this pedal's own Deadzone-Max Force span at
  all, contrary to the claim above. The constant values landed within
  ~0.15kg of `k/7 × 200` — i.e. evenly-spaced sevenths of the fixed
  0-200kg full scale every other Pedal Feel field shares (the original
  node-drag captures that established X as real, `pedal-feel-node{2,5}-
  {x,y}-adjust.pcapng`, happened to be taken at the degenerate 0kg/200kg
  anchors, so they couldn't distinguish "relative to Deadzone-Max Force"
  from "relative to the fixed 0-200kg scale" — both formulas coincide when
  deadzone=0 and maxForce=200).

Net effect of the bug: on every Deadzone or Max Force edit, AZOM was
recomputing BOTH the Y nodes (with the wrong shape) AND the X nodes
(rescaled to the wrong, pedal-specific span instead of the fixed 0-200kg
one) and pushing all 8 values together — likely handing the firmware a
badly warped curve on each edit, which could easily read as "the Deadzone
slider doesn't do anything" rather than a visibly wrong curve. Fixed in
`MozaMBoosterRegistry.FeelCurveFractions` (now `k/7`) and by splitting the
single `ComputeFeelCurve` into `ComputeFeelCurveY` (deadzone-relative,
unchanged) and `ComputeFeelCurveX` (fixed 0-200kg scale, independent of
Deadzone/Max Force) — see `MBoosterDeviceController.PushFeelCurveResync`.
The customized (non-null `InputCurveX`) case now also uses the fixed
0-200kg scale for consistency; this hasn't been independently re-verified
against a customized-curve capture on a non-degenerate Deadzone/Max Force
pair, so treat that specific case as inferred rather than confirmed.

### Pedal Feel node X position

**REVISED**: each of the 6 Pedal Feel nodes is draggable on BOTH axes —
`InputCurveX` on `MBoosterDeviceSettings`/`MBoosterPedalSettings`, a real
hardware write exactly like `InputCurveY`, not just a UI convenience.
Reverse-engineered from four isolated single-node-drag Pit House captures,
`pedal-feel-node{2,5}-{x,y}-adjust.pcapng` (one node dragged on one axis
only, per capture): every drag — on EITHER axis — wrote TWO `0xAB`
selectors together, X first: the node's own `feelcurve-N` Y selector
(`0x08`-`0x0D`, already known) AND a second, distinct selector equal to
the node's own 1-based index (`0x01`-`0x06`), using the identical
kg-relative-to-Deadzone/Max-Force-span encoding as Y. Node 2's low
selector read back `0x02` = 19.29% (user-reported drag target ≈20%); node
5's read back `0x05` ≈ 60% (user-reported drag target ≈64% — the
imprecision here is attributed to eyeballing an on-screen drag rather
than a scale mismatch, since kg-scale and percent-of-span encodings are
numerically identical at the default 0kg/200kg anchors these captures
were taken at).

This selector range (`0x01`-`0x06`) is the SAME one an earlier, less
rigorous investigation spotted exactly once — alongside an unrelated
Travel Start write, not an isolated node drag — and removed as an
unconfirmed guess wired to the wrong curve entirely (see
[Removed: `y1..y5` and `curve7`](#removed-y1y5-and-curve7-historical)
below); these new isolated single-axis captures are the missing evidence
that investigation lacked, and settle it: it's Pedal Feel's own node X,
not a Sim Input Mapping mechanism and not a universal per-write resync.
New wire command names (`mbooster-brake-feelcurve-x-1..6`) were added
rather than reusing the old removed `mbooster-brake-curve7-N` names, to
avoid conflating with that disproven theory. Pushed by the SAME
`MBoosterDeviceController.PushFeelCurveResync` atomic burst as Deadzone/
Max Force/`InputCurveY` — never attached to any other calibration write,
learning from the earlier mechanism's "resync everything" mistake.

The same card also has a **Start/End of Travel (mm)** control —
`TravelStartMm`/`TravelEndMm` on `MBoosterDeviceSettings`. Unlike every
other control in this section, this one is a **real hardware
calibration write, not host-side shaping** — it was originally built
host-side (see git history), but the user confirmed this exact control
exists in Pit House itself, and two real Pit House USB captures
(isolating a drag of just the Start thumb to 10/20/30mm, then just the
End thumb to 40/30mm) turned up two previously-undocumented wire
commands: `mbooster-brake-travel-start` (cmdId `0x84`) and
`mbooster-brake-travel-end` (cmdId `0x85`), group 35 read / 36 write,
2-byte ints — same shape as the raw Min/Max calibration commands.
Encoding mirrors `MaxThresholdKg`'s pattern on a fixed 0–53.5mm scale
(53.5 = `TravelMinMm` 3.8 + `TravelMaxMm` 49.7, i.e. the slider's own
bounds) over the 0–65535 range: `raw = round(mm * 65536 / 53.5)`. All 4
capture data points matched within 1 raw unit (~0.001mm), and the
shared 30mm target hit the identical raw value (`0x8f8d`) via both
cmdIds — as solid a cross-check as the `MaxThresholdKg` evidence had.
See `MozaMBoosterProtocol.EncodeTravelMm`/`DecodeTravelMm`.

This is a genuine dual-thumb range slider (`MozaControls.MozaRangeSlider`,
`UI/Controls/MozaRangeSlider.cs`) — no dual-thumb control existed
anywhere in this app before; every other "linked min/max" pair
(Handbrake, Throttle, Brake, Clutch, mBooster's own raw Min/Max
calibration) is two separate `Slider` controls with mutual clamping
via the shared `OnMinMaxSliderChanged` helper. The two thumbs
(`LowValue`/`HighValue`) are bounded to `[3.8mm, 49.7mm]`
(`MBoosterUiConstants.TravelMinMm`/`TravelMaxMm`) and clamped against
each other so their gap always stays within `[3.8mm, 32.1mm]`
(`TravelMinGapMm`/`TravelMaxGapMm`) — dragging one thumb simply can't
push the gap outside that range. `TravelStartMm`/`TravelEndMm` default
to `-1` (same "not yet set / no override" sentinel as
Direction/Min/Max/`MaxThresholdKg`) so a fresh profile never overwrites
whatever calibration is already on the device; the UI seeds the
slider's displayed position at `[3.8, 35.9]` (the widest allowed
window) when the sentinel is unset, without writing anything until the
user actually drags a thumb.

Right below it are two more real hardware writes: **End Stop Stiffness**
(`EndstopFrontStiffness`/`EndstopEndStiffness`, 1–10 each, labeled "Front
Limit Stiffness"/"End Limit Stiffness" — how hard the pedal feels when it
hits the start/end of its physical travel). Reverse-engineered from two
real Pit House USB captures, each sweeping one slider through all 10
values. Unlike every other mbooster command (one cmdId per field), these
two **share a single cmdId (`0xB2`)** with a fixed `0x00` byte and a
selector byte (`0x00` = front, `0x01` = end) ahead of the 2-byte value —
`mbooster-brake-endstop-front`/`-end` in the command database encode this
as a 3-byte `CommandId` (`{0xB2, 0x00, 0x00}`/`{0xB2, 0x00, 0x01}`), the
same "prefix bytes then payload" shape `main-set-spring-gain` already
uses elsewhere. Fixed 1–10 scale over 0–65535: `raw = round(value * 65535
/ 10)`. All 18 capture points (9 per slider, values 2–10) matched exactly
— including two points that landed on an exact `.5` tie and rounded up,
which is why `EncodeEndstopStiffness` explicitly uses
`MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero` instead of the C# default (round-to-even)
that every other `Encode*` helper here implicitly relies on. Same `-1`
sentinel convention as `TravelStartMm`/`TravelEndMm`.

**Natural Friction** (`NaturalFrictionPct`, 0–100%, labeled "Natural
Friction" — simulates a frictional force independent of game output) is
another genuine hardware write, reverse-engineered from two real Pit
House USB captures: one toggling the setting off/on, and one dragging the
slider through 0/25/50/75/100%. Same "prefix bytes + selector" shape as
End Stop Stiffness above — ONE cmdId (`0xAE`) with a fixed `0x00` byte and
a selector byte (`0x00`/`0x01`) before the 2-byte value
(`mbooster-brake-friction-0`/`-1` in the command database) — but unlike
Endstop's independent front/end values, every capture write sent **both**
selectors with the identical value in the same burst, so the UI always
writes them together rather than exposing two sliders. Fixed 0–100% scale
over 0–65535: `raw = round(pct * 65535 / 100)` — the 0/25/50/75/100%
sweep matched exactly (`0x0000`/`0x4000`/`0x8000`/`0xbfff`/`0xffff`). The
toggle capture cross-checks this: the mBooster's own firmware debug log
(carried in the response stream as ASCII, `param_manage.c` write-confirm
lines) echoed the disabled write as `Table 2, Param 32 Written: 0
0.00000` and the enabled write (slider left at 100%) as `Param 32
Written: 1073741824` (`2^30`, i.e. fixed-point `1.0`) — confirming there
is **no separate wire enable bit**; Pit House's toggle just writes raw 0
when off and restores the last slider value when on. See
`MozaMBoosterProtocol.EncodeFrictionPct`/`DecodeFrictionPct`. Same `-1`
"not yet set / no override" sentinel convention as
`EndstopFrontStiffness`/`EndstopEndStiffness`.

AZOM's own UI (`MBoosterNaturalFrictionEnable`,
`NaturalFrictionEnabled` on both `MBoosterDeviceSettings` and
`MBoosterPedalSettings`, default `true`) reproduces that exact behavior
rather than inventing a new wire concept: switching it off pushes raw 0
immediately (`MBoosterNaturalFrictionEnable_Changed`) without touching
the stored `NaturalFrictionPct`, and disables the slider so a drag can't
implicitly re-enable it; switching back on restores whatever the slider
currently shows. `MozaPlugin.ApplyMBoosterToHardware` mirrors the same
zero-forcing on connect so a profile saved with friction switched off
reconnects silent rather than restoring its last on-wire value.

**Segmented Damping** (labeled "SEGMENTED DAMPING" with its own card, two
plots — "When Pressed" and "When Released") is Pit House's "simulate a
damping force independent of in-game output, dividing pedal travel into
multiple segments with adjustable range and its own natural damping": an
X/Y plot (`MozaControls.MozaSegmentedBarEditor`, a new control — no
bar-chart control existed anywhere in this app before) where the X axis
is 0-100% pedal travel and the Y axis is 0-100% damping. Two draggable
vertical dividers split the plot into 3 segments, each with its own
independently draggable damping bar. Reverse-engineered from 11 real
Pit House USB captures — 6 for "When Pressed" (2 isolating one divider
drag each, 3 isolating one segment's Y-drag each, 1 toggling the feature
off/on) and 5 for "When Released" (2 divider, 3 segment) — cross-checked
against each other to decode the wire shape (see below).

All 6 "When Pressed" captures write the **same single command** — cmdId
`0xB7`, group 36 (write, same `GroupMotorWrite` group the vibration
effects use)/35 (read, unused by any capture — this command isn't part
of `RequestCalibrationReads`' fixed read-burst list) — with a **fixed
21-byte payload**: the cmd byte followed by 10 big-endian `u16` fields,
each `raw = round(pct * 65535 / 100)` (`MozaMBoosterProtocol
.EncodeSegmentedDampingPct`/`DecodeSegmentedDampingPct`). Cross-checking
the "When Pressed" captures against the "When Released" ones (which
exist on disk as `pedal-feel-damping-released-*.pcapng`) revealed the
full field order — critically, **every write resends all 10 fields**,
including ones unrelated to whatever the user was actually dragging in
that particular capture, proving this is always a whole-feature
snapshot, never a partial update:

```text
cmd=0xB7  Div1Pressed  Div2Pressed  Div1Released  Div2Released
          Seg1Pressed  Seg1Released  Seg2Pressed  Seg2Released  Seg3Pressed  Seg3Released
```

Each field's identity is proven by which one varies in lockstep with its
own isolated capture's filename sweep — e.g. `pedal-feel-damping-
pressed-segment2-0-22-57-100.pcapng` is the only capture where the
Seg2Pressed field moves, tracking 0/22/57/100% closely. The two DIVIDER
fields per pair land exactly on `round(pct*65535/100)` (typed/exact
values); the SEGMENT (Y-axis, mouse-dragged) fields are only ever within
about 1 raw unit of that formula — expected, since a drag lands on
whatever pixel row the mouse stopped at (e.g. ~57.002%, not a clean
57%), not the filename's rounded label. See
`MozaMBoosterProtocol.BuildSegmentedDampingFrame`.

This also confirms "When Pressed" and "When Released" are genuinely
**independent** — separate divider pairs, not a shared X axis with two
Y curves — since each side's divider/segment captures never moved the
other side's fields. A recurring, untouched baseline across 5+
independent capture sessions gives confident factory defaults: Divider1/
2 Pressed = 33%/67%, Divider1/2 Released = 20%/70%
(`MBoosterUiConstants.SegDampDivider*DefaultPct`); the very first
capture (the toggle test) shows all-zero segment values, so 0% (no
extra damping) is the default there too
(`MBoosterUiConstants.SegDampSegDefaultPct`).

Divider bounds are Pit House's own and asymmetric per divider — Divider1
∈ [10%, 80%], Divider2 ∈ [20%, 90%] — with a 10% minimum gap enforced
between them (`MBoosterUiConstants.SegDampDivider1MinPct`/`MaxPct`,
`SegDampDivider2MinPct`/`MaxPct`, `SegDampDividerMinGapPct`), confirmed
directly from the two divider-sweep captures' filenames (e.g.
`divider-one-10-34-60-80` sweeps from its 10% floor up to 80%, its
ceiling). Both "When Pressed" and "When Released" have their own plot
(`MBoosterSegmentedDampingSettings.Divider1Pressed`/`Divider2Pressed`/
`Seg1Pressed`/`Seg2Pressed`/`Seg3Pressed` wired to
`MBoosterSegDampPressedPlot_ValuesChanged`; the `*Released` counterparts
wired to `MBoosterSegDampReleasedPlot_ValuesChanged`). Since the wire
command has no partial-update form, both handlers funnel through one
shared `SettingsControl.PushSegmentedDamping` that always resends all 10
fields — editing a divider on the Released plot still re-sends whatever
the Pressed plot currently holds, and vice versa. `-1` = "not yet set /
no override", same sentinel convention as every other Pedal Feel
calibration; a fresh profile writes nothing until the user drags a
divider or a segment on EITHER plot, at which point any still-unset
field on the OTHER plot is filled from the factory defaults above rather
than left blank (the wire frame has no concept of "not sent" per field).

**Enable toggle** (`MBoosterSegDampEnable`,
`MBoosterSegmentedDampingSettings.DampingEnabled`, default `true`): not a
separate wire command — Pit House's own "toggle off/on" capture
(mentioned above) showed all-zero segment values on disable, so AZOM's
toggle reproduces that exactly in software: switching it off sends the
same `BuildSegmentedDampingFrame` with all six segment fields forced to
`0%` (dividers untouched, since they're inert once every segment damps
at 0%), both from the UI (`SettingsControl.PushSegmentedDamping`) and on
connect (`MozaPlugin.ApplyMBoosterToHardware`). Switching it back on
resumes whatever divider/segment values were last stored (or factory
defaults for a still-untouched profile).

### Deadzone / Max Force — REVISED: real hardware calibration, not host-side (bug bundle 5VR5AQ8Y)

The same card also has two force-based sliders, **Deadzone** (`DeadzoneKg`,
0–40kg) and **Max Force** (`MaxForceKg`, 0–200kg). These were originally
implemented as a purely host-side kg-space remap
(`MozaMBoosterRegistry.ApplyDeadzoneAndMaxForce`, applied to the raw HID
axis position before `EvaluateInputCurve`, and clamped to whatever
`MaxThresholdKg` currently resolved to — see git history for that design
and the ceiling bug it needed, `SettingsControl.ApplyMBoosterMaxForceCeiling`).

Two more bug reports for "Max Force does nothing" (5VR5AQ8Y, following
KY3HK4QP) prompted two fresh Pit House USB captures made specifically to
settle the question: `max-force-24-75-128-166-200.pcapng` (Threshold held
fixed, Max Force dragged through 75/128/166kg) and
`deadzone-0-5-11-14.pcapng` (Max Force held fixed at 24kg, Deadzone
dragged through 5/11/14kg). Both confirm the user's own description of
Pit House's real behavior: Deadzone and Max Force **are** real hardware
calibration, not a host-side shim — the previous design's core assumption
was wrong.

Every drag stop in both captures wrote the same family: cmdId `0xAB`
(the same command `mbooster-brake-curve7-*` above uses, but a
**different, previously-undiscovered selector range**), fixed `0x00`
byte, one of 8 selectors, 2-byte big-endian value using the *identical*
kg encoding as `MaxThresholdKg` (`raw = round(kg * 65536 / 200)` — see
`MozaMBoosterProtocol.EncodeThresholdKg`, reused as-is):

- **selector `0x07` = Deadzone** (`mbooster-brake-deadzone`) — confirmed
  exact: 5/11/14kg encoded and decoded back to 5.0/11.0/14.0kg.
- **selector `0x0E` = Max Force** (`mbooster-brake-maxforce`) — confirmed
  exact: 75/128/166kg encoded and decoded back to 75.0/128.0/166.0kg.
- **selectors `0x08`–`0x0D`** = 6 interpolated points between the two
  anchors. Computing `(value - deadzone) / (maxForce - deadzone)` for
  each of the 6 across all 6 write bursts (3 per capture) landed on the
  same constant per selector every time (std-dev < 0.0001), confirming a
  fixed shape independent of which endpoint moved:
  `{0.08049, 0.19495, 0.44245, 0.72433, 0.90040, 0.97910}` for selectors
  `0x08`.. `0x0D` respectively — see
  `MozaMBoosterRegistry.ComputeFeelCurve`/`FeelCurveFractions` and
  `MBoosterDeviceController.PushFeelCurveResync`, which pushes all 8
  values as one burst (same "no partial update" shape as Segmented
  Damping — the device has no way to change one point in isolation).
  Why these specific fractions, rather than an evenly-spaced ramp: not
  determined — treated as an empirically-measured constant, same
  epistemic status as the Segmented Damping factory defaults above.

Selector `0x04` also rides along unchanged in every single burst across
both captures (raw `0x9126`, every time) — it doesn't correlate with
either Deadzone or Max Force, so it's presumably some other Pedal Feel
field Pit House's UI flushes as part of the same batch. Not needed for
Deadzone/Max Force to work and not written by AZOM's own push.

**Max Force is confirmed NOT clamped to Max Threshold on the wire** —
128kg and 166kg were sent as Max Force while Max Threshold read back as
125kg (`mbooster-brake-threshold` readback, same read-all poll that
confirmed selector `0x07`). This directly contradicts the original
design's ceiling logic (`ApplyMBoosterMaxForceCeiling`,
`ResolveFullScaleKg` — both removed): Max Force is an independent
parameter, not a rescale of Threshold's own span. The slider's range is
simply the fixed 0–200kg the XAML always declared.

Like every other real calibration field, both use the shared `-1` "not
yet set / no override" sentinel (previously 0/200 = "off"), so a fresh
profile never overwrites whatever the device already has; once either is
set, the missing one falls back to a sane "off" default (0kg deadzone,
200kg max force) so the write is always a complete, valid curve. Same
brake-named-singleton passive-pedal gating as Travel/End Stop/Friction/
Segmented Damping applies (`MBoosterDeadzoneMaxForcePanel` in
`SettingsControl.xaml`) — cmdId `0xAB`'s selectors carry no per-pedal
address either, so editing them from a passive pedal's page would
overwrite the active pedal's registers the same way KY3HK4QP found for
Travel.

**Further revision**: `InputCurveY`'s 6 nodes are what populate selectors
`0x08`-`0x0D` above — see [Pedal Feel](#pedal-feel). An earlier pass
through this doc (during the same investigation) described those 6
selectors as a fixed, non-adjustable interpolation formula and treated
`InputCurveY` as staying host-side; that turned out to be wrong once the
user clarified Pedal Feel is specifically the curve meant to change the
pedal's physical feel. `FeelCurveFractions` (the constant array measured
below) is kept, just reframed as the curve's default/Linear shape rather
than a hard rule.

### Removed: `y1..y5` and `curve7` (historical)

Two mechanisms this investigation built, then removed once the Sim Input
Mapping / Pedal Feel split above was clarified — kept here for context,
matching this doc's convention of preserving past-bug/decision history
rather than deleting it:

- **`mbooster-{throttle,brake,clutch}-y1..y5`** (cmdIds 14-29,
  non-sequential per role, 4-byte float, group 35/36) — a genuinely
  confirmed-via-capture wire mechanism, believed to be the Sim Input
  Mapping output curve's real encoding (5 points at fixed 20/40/60/80/100%
  breakpoints). Removed once it became clear the output curve is purely
  host-side (see above) — the confirmed capture evidence for these 15
  commands existing is not in question, only whether AZOM's output curve
  should be sending them, and it turns out it shouldn't.
- **`curve7`** (`0xAB` selectors `0x01`-`0x06`, cmdId shared with the
  entirely separate Deadzone/Max Force/Pedal-Feel-curve family at
  selectors `0x07`-`0x0E` above) — at the time, EXPERIMENTAL/unconfirmed:
  spotted exactly once, alongside a Travel Start write in
  `pedal_travel.pcapng`,
  and speculatively wired into `QueueMBoosterCalibPush` (`SettingsControl
  .xaml.cs`) as an automatic resync tacked onto EVERY other calibration
  write (Direction/Min/Max/CurveY/Travel/Endstop/Friction/SegmentedDamping/
  Ratio), on the theory the same firmware requirement applied broadly.
  This session's more rigorous, isolated captures directly disconfirmed it
  for Max Threshold and Deadzone/Max Force specifically (zero `0xAB`
  selector `0x01`-`0x06` traffic alongside their real writes) — and once
  neither redesigned curve needed it either, the whole mechanism (
  `ResampleCurveAtSevenths`, `EncodeCurve7Point`, `PushCurve7Resync`, the 6
  `AddCommand` entries, and every `needsCurve7Resync`/`includeCurve7Resync`
  call site) was removed rather than kept half-justified for Travel alone
  — Travel's own write already reads back correctly without it (per the
  original Travel writeup above); only the resync's *additional* benefit
  was ever unconfirmed, not the base write.
  **Later confirmed, not disproven**: this exact selector range turned out
  to be real after all — just not a universal resync, and not tied to
  Travel/Sim Input Mapping/`stroke_curve` (all speculated elsewhere in this
  doc). Four fresh isolated captures that actually dragged individual
  Pedal Feel nodes (rather than an unrelated control) showed `0x01`-`0x06`
  is that curve's own per-node X position — see
  [Pedal Feel node X position](#pedal-feel-node-x-position) above, added
  back under new command names (`mbooster-brake-feelcurve-x-1..6`) so as
  not to resurrect the old, wrong `curve7`/universal-resync theory.

Net effect: Direction/Min/Max/Travel/Endstop/Friction/SegmentedDamping/
Ratio/Threshold no longer drag any resync behind their writes — just the
one write each already documented above, with `QueueCalibWrite`'s 400ms
debounce still doing its job of collapsing a drag into one write set.

### Traction Control — new effect, no verified wire type

Sixth vibration effect (Brake Fade, added earlier, isn't one — see
above), added as a direct mirror of ABS: same oscillating-pulse
waveform (`MBoosterEffectSynthesizer.SynthesizeTractionControl`, an
exact copy of `SynthesizeAbs`'s formula in its own function), same
sustained Test toggle semantics, driven by SimHub's `TCActive`
telemetry (`MBoosterTelemetrySnapshot.TcActive`) the same way ABS is
driven by `AbsActive`. Two sliders (Frequency, Intensity) — no
Smoothness; a later pass (see "Frequency range + Smoothness removal"
below) widened Frequency to 10–100Hz and dropped the Smoothness slider
entirely (fixed internally at `smoothness01 = 1`), so it's no longer a
complete ABS mirror on the UI side either.

The one place it can't be a pure mirror: ABS has a real, capture-
verified wire effect type (1); Traction Control has never been seen in
a Pit House capture, so there's no confirmed protocol ID to send. It
reuses Engine's already-verified frame shape (effect type 4) instead —
the same reuse Custom Effects make (see `ProcessCustomEffect` above) —
via its own `ProcessTractionControlEffect`, rather than inventing an
unconfirmed ID and risking the firmware misinterpreting it. Practical
consequence: Traction Control competes with the real Engine effect and
any active Custom Effects for that one wire slot; it's placed last in
the `Tick()` priority ladder (same tier as ABS/Lockup/Threshold) so it
always wins over ambient vibration when active.

The sustained Test toggle substitutes live throttle position for
`tcActive` (gated at 80% throttle, mirroring ABS's 60%-brake gate) —
this needed a new `MBoosterTelemetrySnapshot.Throttle` field and a
`MBoosterEffectWorker.EffectiveThrottle` helper (mirroring
`EffectiveBrake`), since the snapshot previously only carried Brake.

### Wheel Spin — Traction Control's physics-heuristic sibling

Seventh vibration effect, added with the exact same slider config as
Traction Control (Frequency 10–100Hz, Intensity, no Smoothness) and the
same Engine-wire-slot reuse (`ProcessWheelSpinEffect`,
`MBoosterEffectSynthesizer.SynthesizeWheelSpin` — another exact copy of
`SynthesizeAbs`'s formula), but a deliberately different trigger:
rather than reading SimHub's `TCActive` flag (which reflects whether
the *game's own* TC system chose to intervene), Wheel Spin runs its own
raw wheel-slip physics heuristic in `UpdateWheelSpinRequest` — the
acceleration-side counterpart to Lockup's braking-side heuristic (see
"Lockup rebuild" above):

```text
isSpinning = throttle > 0.8 && vehicleSpeed < 40 && avgWheelSpeed > vehicleSpeed * 1.3
```

gated to `vehicleSpeed < 40` m/s (~144 km/h) since wheelspin is a
low/mid-speed launch or corner-exit phenomenon, not something that
should fire from flooring the throttle at speed in a tall gear. Same
fallback rationale as Lockup: `AvgWheelSpeedMs` is currently always 0
in this plugin (`MozaPlugin.DataUpdate` hardcodes it — no per-wheel
speed telemetry is wired up yet), so the primary condition never
actually fires yet; a fallback (`avgWheelSpeed <= 0 && throttle > 0.9 &&
vehicleSpeed < 40`) carries the real behavior today, same as Lockup's
own fallback does. The sustained Test toggle substitutes live throttle
position (via the same `EffectiveThrottle` helper Traction Control
uses), gated at 80% throttle.

This makes ABS/Traction Control (simple game-flag effects) and
Lockup/Wheel Spin (raw physics-heuristic effects) a deliberate
symmetric pair — one braking-side, one acceleration-side, in each
category.

### Frequency range + Smoothness removal (Traction Control)

Shortly after Traction Control was added, its Frequency range was
widened from 5–30Hz (ABS's range) to 10–100Hz, and its Smoothness
slider was removed entirely — `UpdateTractionControlRequest` now fixes
`smoothness01 = 1` internally instead of reading a (now nonexistent)
`SmoothnessPct` slider value. Wheel Spin was built to this same,
already-updated slider config from the start (see above) rather than
the original ABS-mirrored one.

### Gear Shift — the first genuine one-shot pulse effect

Eighth vibration effect, and the first one in this pipeline that
doesn't fit the "level-triggered continuous, re-evaluated every tick"
model every other effect (built-in or Custom) uses. It's a pulse: fire
briefly on a detected gear change, then self-terminate, even though the
underlying telemetry signal that triggered it is itself only true for
one tick.

**Detection** mirrors the wheelbase's own gear-shift feature
(`MozaPlugin.CheckGearshiftEvent`, see "Effects card UI" above) almost
exactly: a string-latch edge detector on SimHub's `Gear` telemetry
(`string`, values `"R"`/`"N"`/`"1"`–`"N"`), with a warm-up guard (the
first observed value is just recorded, never fires) so plugin/session
startup doesn't produce a false shift event. Computed once, globally,
in `MozaPlugin.DataUpdate` with its own independent latch
(`_lastMBoosterGearString` — separate from the wheelbase's
`_lastGearString` and the AB9 shifter's `_lastAb9GearString`, so none
of the three interfere with each other), producing two new
`MBoosterTelemetrySnapshot` fields: `GearChanged` (true for exactly the
one tick the gear string differed from the previous tick) and
`GearIsNeutral` (whether the *new* gear is "N"/"0"). Unlike the
wheelbase's version, no debounce or neutral-suppression decision is
made at this global layer — those are per-mBooster-device settings
(`VibrateOnNeutral`, `DebounceMs`), applied independently by each
device's own `UpdateGearShiftRequest`, same as every other Gear Shift
setting.

**The pulse mechanic itself** (`MBoosterEffectWorker
.UpdateGearShiftRequest`/`GearShiftPulseDurationSec` = 150ms) is new
machinery, not a reuse of anything Lockup/Threshold already had —
investigation confirmed neither of those is a true one-shot despite
having "pulse" or "burst" in their envelope descriptions: both stay
`Active` and keep re-evaluating for as long as their gate condition
holds, only deactivating when the gate goes false again. Gear Shift
can't work that way since `GearChanged` reverts to false on the very
next tick regardless of anything. Instead, `UpdateGearShiftRequest`
reads back `EffectState.Active`/`ElapsedSec` (already tracked by
`ProcessGearShiftEffect`, mirroring `ProcessTractionControlEffect`) to
know "am I already mid-pulse, and for how long" — if so, it keeps
requesting nonzero intensity until `GearShiftPulseDurationSec` elapses,
independent of the raw edge; only once that latch clears does it look
for a *new* `GearChanged` edge to start another pulse. The Debounce
window is tracked separately, in a plain `_gearShiftDebounceRemainingSec`
field decremented each tick — it has to live outside `EffectState`
since it must survive across the pulse's own on/off cycle (`ElapsedSec`
resets to 0 every time the pulse (re)activates).

Same Engine-wire-slot reuse as Traction Control/Wheel Spin (no
verified wire effect type of its own), and a new waveform,
`MBoosterEffectSynthesizer.SynthesizeGearShift` — a short oscillating
burst (`0.7 + 0.3*sin(phase)`, so it never crosses zero mid-burst)
multiplied by a linear decay envelope over the pulse duration, rather
than the plain continuous wave every other effect in this file uses.

Slider config, at the user's explicit request, mirrors the wheelbase's
own gear-shift feature in full rather than staying minimal like
Traction Control/Wheel Spin: Enable, Test, Frequency (10-100Hz),
Intensity, **and** a Vibrate on Neutral toggle + Debounce (ms) slider
(0-1000ms, 50ms steps — same bounds/step as
`GearshiftDebounceSlider`). The Test toggle bypasses the pulse/debounce/
neutral machinery entirely, same substitution every other effect's
test makes — there's no live "gear just changed" signal to press
against outside a real shift.

### Live position indicator on the curves

Both the Pedal Feel input curve and the Sim Input Mapping output curve
show a live dot on the spline (plus a dashed guide line down to the
X axis) tracking the pedal as it's pressed, at 30Hz
(`SettingsControl.UpdateMBoosterCurveMarkers`, which sets
`MozaCurveEditor.LiveX` on both editors — this used to also drive a
standalone position bar in the Pedal Role card, since removed in favor
of these two curve markers).

`MozaCurveEditor.LiveX` is a data-space X (0–100, same domain as
`XAxisLabels`); `NaN` (default) hides the indicator. `Recompute()`
maps it to a pixel X via the same `XAxisLabels`/`XLabelFractions`
correspondence used for tick labels (linear interpolation between
whichever two labels bracket it), locates which cached Bezier segment
contains that pixel X, then inverts that segment's X(t) via bisection
— the same approach as `EvaluateInputCurve`, just in pixel space — to
read off the exact point ON the spline. The two editors get different
values so each shows what it actually receives:

- **Input Curve**: `LastRawPercentPreCurve` — post deadzone/max-force,
  pre-`InputCurveY` (what this curve's evaluator receives).
- **Output Curve**: `LastHidPosition * 100` (post-`InputCurveY`, i.e.
  what's sent onward to game telemetry) — an approximation of what the
  device's own firmware curve sees, since that runs on the device's
  own raw sensor reading, a separate signal path we don't otherwise
  observe.

A separate card (Pit House calls this class of setting "input
mapping") holds the Pit House-parity controls, all still under
`MBoosterDeviceSettings`:

- **Sensor Output Ratio** (`SensorOutputRatioPct`, 0–100%) — blend
  between the mBooster's angle sensor (0%) and its load cell (100%).
  Wired to `mbooster-brake-angle-ratio` (cmdId 26) — the mBooster-side
  twin of the wheelbase Brake tab's own "Sensor Ratio" slider
  (`pedals-brake-angle-ratio`). Live-pushes on every drag.
- **Max Threshold (kg)** (`MaxThresholdKg`) — Pit House's "load cell
  force at which output reaches 100%" setting. **Reverse-engineered
  from two real Pit House USB captures** (not in any protocol note —
  see below). Wire command `mbooster-brake-threshold`, cmdId `0xB3`,
  group 35 read / 36 write, 4 bytes — but unlike every other 4-byte
  mbooster command, this one is a **big-endian unsigned int, not an
  IEEE-754 float**. It encodes kg on a fixed 0–200kg scale over the
  same 0–65535 range used elsewhere, mirroring the exact
  `EncodeFreq`/`ComputeParam1` "value × 65536 / 200" pattern already
  used for the motor effects in this same file:
  `raw = round(kg × 65536 / 200)`. See
  `MozaMBoosterProtocol.EncodeThresholdKg`/`DecodeThresholdKg`.

  **Evidence**: a capture isolating a drag to exactly 4kg produced
  `7e 05 24 12 b3 00 00 05 1f 61` → raw `1311`, and
  `round(4 × 65536 / 200) = 1311` exactly. A second, earlier capture
  (target value not recorded) produced raw `41287`, which decodes to
  `125.9998kg` — matching an independently-reported real Pit House
  setting of ~125kg to within rounding error. Two independent
  confirmations is about as solid as unofficial reverse-engineering
  gets, but it's still unconfirmed by Moza — the in-UI warning says so.
- **Output curve** (`CurveY`, 5-point) — moved here from Calibration.
  `MozaCurveEditor`-driven, mirrors the wheelbase pedal Y curves.
  Like Direction/Min/Max, always writes through the
  `mbooster-throttle-y1..y5` slot regardless of the device's assigned
  role — the mBooster is a single physical axis, so role-specific
  slots are reserved for symmetry with the wheelbase's three-pedal
  command surface but unlikely to matter on real hardware (see
  `SetMBoosterCurveY` in `SettingsControl.xaml.cs`).

  Unlike every other curve in the app, this one's nodes are also
  **draggable horizontally** (`MozaCurveEditor.AllowHorizontalDrag`,
  set only on this instance), so a node can be moved to a lower X and
  "100% output" reached before "100% input" — the same idea as Pedal
  Feel's Max Force slider, applied to the output side instead. The
  wheelbase's own FFB curve has real `base-ffb-curve-x1..x4` write
  commands for this; **no equivalent exists for the mbooster y-curve**
  (nothing found in captures or the command table), so this is
  implemented purely host-side: `MBoosterDeviceSettings.CurveX` stores
  each node's dragged X (null = untouched, fixed 20/40/60/80/100), and
  `MozaMBoosterRegistry.ResampleCurveAtFixedBreakpoints` — via the new
  `EvaluateCurveArbitraryX`, the same Catmull-Rom/bisection approach as
  `EvaluateInputCurve` but generalized to non-fixed node X — resamples
  the whole (CurveX, CurveY) shape at the wire protocol's actual fixed
  breakpoints before every push (`PushResampledMBoosterCurve` in
  `SettingsControl.xaml.cs`, called on every X or Y change, plus
  `ApplyMBoosterToHardware` on detect). Beyond the last dragged node,
  the resample returns that node's Y (flat plateau) — verified
  numerically: with `CurveX` untouched, resampling is the exact
  identity; dragging the last node from X=100 to X=60 (Y unchanged)
  makes breakpoints 60/80/100 all resample to that node's Y.

All targeted at device id `0x12` on the mBooster's own CDC port. The
plugin's [`MozaResponseParser`](../../../Protocol/MozaResponseParser.cs)
disambiguates from wheelbase Main / AB9 Main via the
`busHint: "mbooster"` argument set in `MBoosterDeviceController.OnConnectionMessage`.

## HID identity reconciliation

The registry walk in [`MozaPortDiscovery`](../../../Protocol/MozaPortDiscovery.cs)
surfaces an `InstanceId` per CDC composite (e.g. `a&399b951f&0&0000`).
HidSharp's `HidDevice.DevicePath` contains a similar parent-USB
instance segment between the second and third `#` separators (e.g.
`\\?\HID#VID_346E&PID_0008&MI_02#a&399b951f&0&0002#{4d1e55b2-...}`).
The plugin's `MozaHidReader.ExtractUsbParentInstance` extracts that
segment as the HID-side identity.

**Resolved by real-hardware logs** (a support bundle showing the
position bar stuck at 0 despite the device showing "Connected"): the
"shared prefix, differing only in trailing interface index" theory
above is **wrong**. A real capture showed:

```text
HID: 9&1bd82a3a&0&0000
CDC: 8&1709245b&0&0000
```

No shared segment at all — Windows assigned the HID and CDC
interfaces of the same physical device completely unrelated instance
IDs (different hash, not just a different trailing index). An
exact-match lookup in `MozaMBoosterRegistry.OnHidAxisUpdate` never
pairs these, so the position bar never updates even though the CDC
side detects fine, and no amount of prefix-stripping can fix it for
this device.

`MozaMBoosterRegistry.OnHidAxisUpdate` tries three things in order:

1. **Exact match** — works if Windows ever does assign the same
   instance ID to both interfaces (kept for hardware/driver versions
   where it might).
2. **`FindByInstancePrefixLocked`** — strips the trailing `&NNNN`
   segment from both sides and matches on the remainder. Kept as a
   fallback for the case the original theory *did* describe, even
   though it's now known not to be the common case.
3. **Single-device fallback** — if neither match and exactly one
   mBooster is registered, pair the HID identity to it unconditionally;
   there's no ambiguity with only one device. This is what actually
   fixes the common single-mBooster case given the finding above.

Each path logs once per HID identity at Info level so a support-bundle
log confirms which one resolved the device (`"...via instance-prefix
fallback..."` / `"...via single-device fallback..."`). With two or
more mBoosters that never exact- or prefix-match, there is currently
no way to disambiguate which HID stream belongs to which CDC device —
`LogUnmatchedHidIdentityOnceLocked` logs a Warn (visible in SimHub's
regular log, not just the bundle) so that gap is at least visible
rather than silent.

### Pedal Trace — all-pedals overlay, not just the selected mBooster

The Effects card's **Pedal Trace** sparkline (`MBoosterPedalTraceViz`)
originally plotted only the currently selected device's own HID
position, single-series, reset to a flat baseline on device switch (see
above). It's now a fixed three-series overlay — Brake (red), Throttle
(green), Clutch (blue) — showing every connected pedal's live position
at once, independent of which device's tab is open, and no longer
cleared on device switch since the history is no longer tied to a
single device.

`MozaControls.BandwidthSparkline` gained a third series
(`ThirdSamples`/`ThirdBrush`/`ThirdFillBrush`, same shape as the
existing `In`/`Out` pair) to make this possible with two series
reserved for it already. `SettingsControl` feeds it from
`_data.BrakePosition`/`ThrottlePosition`/`ClutchPosition` — the same
merged 0-100 values the Inputs tab's pedal bars already use — rather
than from the mBooster registry, so pedals that aren't mBoosters at all
(e.g. a dedicated load-cell brake) still show up on the graph. The
curve editors' own live-position markers (`MBoosterInputCurveEditor`/
`MBoosterCurveEditor`) are unaffected — those stay tied to the
currently selected device, matching what its own curve sliders shape.

`RedBrush`/`McuFillBrush` and `GreenBrush`/`MotorFillBrush` reuse the
existing theme pairs (same red/green the temperature graph's MCU/Motor
series use). `BlueBrush`/`BwThirdFillBrush` are new — no prior accent
color in the theme was a true blue distinct from Cyan.

## PitHouse Pedals preset format

A PitHouse preset is a JSON object (or a `.mzpreset` zip holding `preset.json`
— see `UI/Import/PitHousePresetArchive.cs`) whose `deviceParams` object holds
every setting as a flat key. mBooster presets carry `"deviceType": "Pedals"`
and `"devices": ["mBooster"]`.

Sample files these notes were derived from: two real user presets, `Brake`
(100 `deviceParams` keys, saved 2026-07-14) and `Throttle` (88 keys,
2026-07-18), from the same rig.

### Per-role prefixes, and the subject role

Every key except a handful of device-wide ones is prefixed `throttle_`,
`brake_` or `clutch_`. **A preset written for one pedal still carries all
three sections** — but only its own role gets the extended block (effects,
travel limits, damping/friction, force curves). The other two hold just the
device-wide snapshot:

```text
channlRoleType, outdir, min, max, nonlinear1..5, press_combine
```

So the section carrying **any key outside that generic set** identifies the
role the preset is really for — its *subject role*. In `Brake.json` only
`brake_*` qualifies; in `Throttle.json` only `throttle_*` does.

This matters because the other sections are *not* settings for those pedals in
any meaningful sense — they are whatever the device happened to report when
the preset was saved. `PitHousePedalsMapper` therefore imports only the subject
section, into one pedal (`ImportPlan.ResolvedTarget`, retargetable in the
wizard). Importing all three overwrote the untouched pedals' calibration.

A preset with no extended block in any section has no discernible subject; the
mapper treats it as a plain calibration snapshot and matches each populated
section to the pedal carrying that role (`ImportPlan.IsCalibrationOnlyPreset`).

### Key → plugin field

Prefixed `<p>` = `throttle` / `brake` / `clutch`. Every effect field is
host-rendered (see [Effect synthesis](#effect-synthesis)); the calibration
rows reach the device through `MozaPlugin.ApplyMBoosterToHardware`.

Values are clamped to the plugin's own slider bounds (`MBoosterUiConstants`)
on import, and the travel pair additionally honours `TravelMinGapMm` /
`TravelMaxGapMm` so an imported range can't land somewhere the UI could not
produce.

### `<p>_min` / `<p>_max` — percent vs raw counts

PitHouse states these as **percentages**: every observed value across both
sample presets is in 0–100 (`clutch_min: 0` / `clutch_max: 100` is the
full-range default; `brake_min: 16`, `brake_max: 99`, `throttle_min: 3`), and
they sit alongside `nonlinear1..5`, which are unambiguously percentages.

`MBoosterDeviceSettings.Min`/`Max` are the device's own **raw counts** — the
Calibration card's sliders are labelled "Min (raw)"/"Max (raw)", run 0–65535
(the 2-byte field's range), and are seeded from the device read-back, unlike
every other min/max slider in the app, which clamps 0–100.

The importer therefore does **not** map them. Writing PitHouse's `max: 99`
straight into the raw field caps the pedal's output at ~0.15 % of full scale.
The percent→raw factor is not established by any capture (the raw full-scale a
given unit actually reports is not necessarily 65535), so the values are listed
under "Not imported" with their reason rather than guessed at. A capture of
PitHouse writing `mbooster-<p>-min`/`-max` after a known slider value would
settle it.

### The three inferred mappings

These are read from value range, **not** from a wire capture, and are marked
with `*` in the import wizard's change list:

- `machinelimit_min/max` → travel in **mm**. Samples are 34.97/45.0 and
  35.99/46.69, sitting inside the plugin's own 3.8–49.7 mm Start/End of Travel
  slider (itself reverse-engineered from PitHouse captures of that control).
- `softlimit_hardness_press/release` → End Stop Stiffness. Samples are `3`,
  inside the confirmed 1–10 range; press↔front / release↔end is the natural
  pairing.
- `press_combine` → sensor blend ratio. Present only under `brake_` (70 in the
  Brake preset, 0 in the Throttle preset's brake snapshot), matching
  `SensorOutputRatioPct`'s own brake-only scope. Weakest of the three.

### Not imported — no plugin surface

`<p>_damping_*` (including the 3-segment `_segment{1,2,3}_{position,value}`
curve), `<p>_friction_*`, `<p>_forcelimit_min/max`, `<p>_gforce_*`,
`<p>_motor_vibration_*` (PitHouse's own motor test; `_balance` has no
counterpart at all), and the device-wide `force_max_coef`, `pressure_weight`,
`enter_sleep_time`, `game_mode`. The un-prefixed `machinelimit_*`,
`softlimit_hardness_*`, `damping_*`, `friction_*`, `forcelimit_min` are
device-wide copies of the per-pedal keys — the importer reads the prefixed ones
because those say which pedal they belong to.

Every one of these is listed with its value and a reason in the wizard's "Not
imported" card; `PitHouseMotorMapper.SweepUnhandled` is the backstop, so a key
PitHouse adds later still surfaces rather than vanishing.

### CRP / CRP2 / SRP presets — the passive-pedal route

`deviceType: "Pedals"` covers the passive pedal sets too, not just the mBooster.
Those have no motor, so their presets are the **calibration-only** shape: just
the generic per-role block (`channlRoleType`, `outdir`, `min`, `max`,
`nonlinear1..5`, `press_combine`) for all three roles, with none of the effect /
travel / force families above. A real CRP2 preset observed in a user bundle
carries 31 `deviceParams` keys against the mBooster samples' 88–100.

The subject-role rule does **not** apply to them. It exists because an mBooster
is one pedal per device, so a preset's other two sections are filler; a CRP is
one device carrying all three pedals, so every populated section is that
device's own throttle / brake / clutch. `PitHouseCrpPedalsMapper` therefore
imports all three, and there is no target to pick.

`devices` is the family discriminator the wizard routes on (mBooster presets
name `"mBooster"` — see the top of this section). A Pedals preset that does not
name the mBooster goes to the CRP surface whenever CRP-family pedals are
detected; with none detected it stays on the mBooster path so the "no mBooster
pedal attached" note is what the user sees.

| PitHouse key          | Plugin field                    | Wire command               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `<p>_outdir`          | `MozaProfile.Pedals<P>Dir`      | `pedals-<p>-dir`           |
| `<p>_min` / `<p>_max` | `Pedals<P>Min` / `Pedals<P>Max` | `pedals-<p>-min` / `-max`  |
| `<p>_nonlinear1..5`   | `Pedals<P>Curve[0..4]`          | `pedals-<p>-y1..y5`        |
| `brake_press_combine` | `PedalsBrakeAngleRatio`         | `pedals-brake-angle-ratio` |
| `<p>_channlRoleType`  | *(not imported)*                | — (CRP roles are fixed)    |

`min`/`max` **are** imported here, unlike on the mBooster path: the CRP fields
are percent on both sides (`MozaProfile.PedalsThrottleMin` is documented 0-100,
the sliders are `Minimum=0 Maximum=100`, and the wire value is a percent — a
capture of the plugin writing `pedals-throttle-max` shows `24 12 03 00 63` for
99 %). The mBooster's raw-count mismatch is a property of *its* plugin fields,
not of PitHouse's units. The pair is emitted as one row clamped to `min ≤ max`,
mirroring `OnMinMaxSliderChanged`; a `max` of 0 is dropped with a note, because
`ApplyPedalsToHardware` treats 0 as the "unset" sentinel and would skip the
write while the profile and tab moved.

Imported values land on the profile and reach the device through the normal
`ApplyProfile` → `ApplyPedalsToHardware` push, so the CRP path needs no
equivalent of `ImportPlan.TouchedMBoosters`.

### Open questions

- **`<prefix>_channlRoleType` semantics are unresolved.** In both samples the
  *populated* section reads `2` (`brake_channlRoleType: 2` in `Brake.json`,
  `throttle_channlRoleType: 2` in `Throttle.json`) while the other two read 1
  and 3. That is inconsistent with the plugin's own `MBoosterRole` enum
  (1=Throttle, 2=Brake, 3=Clutch), so the field is *not* simply the section's
  role. Two files can't settle it — the importer marks the key considered and
  ignores it, using the extended-key test above instead. More samples (a clutch
  preset, or presets from a differently-wired rig) would resolve this.
- **`stroke_curve` (6 floats) + `forces_curve` (7 floats) look like one
  force-vs-travel curve.** `brake_stroke_curve` spans 36.4–43.6, the same range
  as `brake_machinelimit_min/max` (⇒ likely **mm**); `brake_forces_curve` spans
  16.1–47.0, the same range as `brake_forcelimit_min/max` (11/47, ⇒ likely
  **kg**). The throttle preset's equivalents are lighter throughout
  (4.3–12.0 kg vs the brake's 16–47), which is what a throttle-vs-brake pedal
  pair should look like. The old `mbooster-brake-curve7-1..6` family this
  paragraph originally pointed at (`0xAB`, 6 selectors, fed by
  `ResampleCurveAtSevenths`) was removed as an unconfirmed guess (see
  "Removed: y1..y5 and curve7") — but that exact `0xAB` `0x01`-`0x06`
  selector range was later confirmed real, as Pedal Feel's own per-node X
  position (`InputCurveX`, see [Pedal Feel node X position]
  (#pedal-feel-node-x-position)), which is a plausible match for
  `stroke_curve` on its face (position-along-travel, mm-scale) — still
  unconfirmed against this specific PitHouse-export field until a capture
  ties the two together.
